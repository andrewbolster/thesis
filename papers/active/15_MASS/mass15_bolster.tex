% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

% ADDED BY BOLSTER
\usepackage{amssymb}





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

This paper presents a methodology for establishing continuous trust based on sparse and asynchronous trust metric observations across multiple domains of measurement.
Using Grey Sequence Buffer Operations and Grey Generator Filters, we show that by performing per-domain filtering \todo{is there a better phrase for 'filling in the gaps'} while performing cross-domain vector whitenization, a more stable and practical trust assessment is produced. 

We test this methodology within the context of an Underwater Autonomous Network.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
Many trust systems operate on the basis of establishing closed system models based on noisy or perturbed information inputs, sourced by decentralised agents or nodes, with an aim to collaboratively establishing additional information about the expected states and behaviours of other agents within a system.\todo{Need to say somewhere that 'agent' and 'node' are used interchangeably in this document}
As such, trust systems can be described as fundamentally uncertain, particularly in the areas or reputation establishment and trust chaining.\cite{someone}.
Adding to this state the highly dynamic features of many aspects of trust theory applications (Ad Hoc Networks, Online Markets, etc.), we can generalise the sources of incomplete information from a single nodes perspective as being part of 4 cases.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Information on the system's boundary is incomplete
  \item Information about the range of system behaviours is incomplete
  \item Information about the structure of the system is incomplete or out of date
  \item Information about observed parameters (metrics) is incomplete or out of date.
\end{itemize}

These cases of incompleteness of information are closely mirrored by those for which grey theory was originally posited as a form of system modeling, putting information incompleteness at the centre of the assessment. 
While some work \cite{Guo11} has been done to apply grey theory to a trust context, it has not been fully explored.
Guo applies grey analysis to generate a ``trust vector'' from the grey whitenisation of independent or near-independent metrics. 
In this paper we demonstrate a methodology that applies Grey Sequence operations and Grey Generators (conceptually analogous to Sequential Bayesian Filtering``) to provide continuous trust assessment in a sparse, asynchronous metric space across multiple domains of trust.

\section{Trust as an incomplete system characteristic}

While application specific trust management frameworks are often based on a very limited space of available metrics, the problem of establishing trust in dynamical systems such as social, economic or autonomous systems have the opportunity to tap in to a wide range of potential metric spaces. 
Taking the example of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET), the variable most applied to the assessment of trust is the packet error rate, or more generally, the number of successful and unsuccessful interactions between two agents within a system.
However, a wealth of other information is available within this example; for instance the delay in communications from one node to another; the total throughput of particular network links; and in the case of wireless networks, the strength of received signals.
Looking beyond the communications domain, within such a MANET, information is also usually available regarding the physical domain of a network; the relative positioning and motions of nodes within a network can also be used to inform the generation of trust assessments.

\section{Grey System Theory}

\subsection{Grey numbers, operators and terminology}

Grey numbers are used to represent values where their discrete value is unknown, where that number may take its possible value within an interval of potential values, generally written using the symbol $\oplus$.
Taking $a$ and $b$ as the lower and upper bounds of the grey interval respectively, such that $\oplus \in [a,b] | a < b$ 
The ``field'' of $\oplus$ is the value space $[a,b]$.
There are several classifications of grey numbers based on the relationships between these bounds.\todo{don't think classification is the right word here}

Black and White numbers are the extremes of this classification; such that $\dot\oplus \in [-\infty, +\infty]$ and $\mathring\oplus \in [x, x] | x \in \mathbb{R}$ or $\oplus(x)$
It is clear that white numbers such as $\mathring\oplus$ have a field of zero while black numbers have an infinite field.

Grey numbers may represent partial knowledge about a system or metric, and as such can represent half-open concepts, by only defining a single bound; for example $\underline\oplus = \oplus(\underline x ) \in [x, +\infty]$ and $\overline\oplus = \oplus(\overline x) \in [-\infty, x]$.

Primary operations within this number system are as follows;

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \oplus_1 + \oplus_2      &\in [a_1+a_2,b_1+b_2] \label{eq:grey_add}\\
           -\oplus         &\in [-b,-a] \label{eq:grey_neg} \\
  \oplus_1 - \oplus_2      &= \oplus_1+(-\oplus) \label{eq:grey_sub}\\
  \oplus_1 \times \oplus_2 &\in \begin{aligned}[t]
    &[\min(a_1 a_2, a_1 b_2, b_1 a_2, b_2 a_2), \\
    & \max(a_1 a_2, a_1 b_2, b_1 a_2, b_2 a_2)]
  \end{aligned} \label{grey_mult}\\
  \oplus^{-1} &\in [b^{-1}, a^{-1}] \label{eq:grey_inv}\\
  \oplus_1 / \oplus_2 & = \oplus_1 \times \oplus_2^{-1} \label{grey_mult} \\
  \oplus \times k &\in [ka,kb] \label{eq:grey_times_scalar}\\
  \oplus^k &\in [a^k, b^k] \label{eq:grey_exp}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $k$ is a scalar quantity.
  
\subsection{Whitenisation and the Grey Core}

The characterisation of grey numbers is based on the encapsulation of information in a grey system in terms of the grey numbers core ($\hat\oplus$) and it's degree of greyness ($g^\circ$).
If the distribution of a grey number field is unknown and continuous, $\hat\oplus = \frac{a + b}{2}$.

Non-essential grey numbers are those that can be represented by a white number obtained either through experience or particular method. \cite{Liu2011}
This white hissed value is represented by $\tilde\oplus$ or $\oplus(x)$ to represent grey numbers with $x$ as their whitenisation.
In some cases depending on the context of application, particular gray numbers may temporarily have no reasonable whitenisation value (for instance, a black number). Such numbers are said to be Essential grey numbers.

\subsection{Grey Sequence Buffers and Generators}

\todo{eqs of sequence buffers and partial derivs}

Given a fully populated value space, sequence buffer operations are used to provide abstractions over the dataspace.
These abstractions can be \emph{weakening} or \emph{strengthening}.
In the weakening case, these operations perform a level of smoothing on the volatility of a given input space, and strengthening buffers serve to highlight and 

A powerful tool in grey system theory is the use of grey incidence factors, comparing the ``likeness'' of one value against a cohort of values.
This usefulness applies particularly well in the case of multi-agent trust networks, where the aim is to detect and identify malicious or maladaptive behaviour, rather than an absolute assessment of ``trustworthiness''.

\subsection{Grey Trust}

Grey Theory performs cohort based normalization of metrics at runtime. 
This creates a more stable contextual assessment of trust, providing a ``grade'' of trust compared to other observed nodes in that interval, while maintaining the ability to reduce trust values down to a stable assessment range for decision support without requiring every environment entered into to be characterised.
Grey assessments are relative in both fairly and unfairly operating networks.
Nodes will receive mid-range trust assessments if there are no malicious actors as there is no-one else ``bad'' to compare against.

Guo\cite{Guo11} demonstrated the ability of Grey Relational Analysis (GRA)\cite{Zuo1995} to normalise and combine disparate traits of a communications link such as instantaneous throughput, received signal strength, etc. into a Grey Relational Coefficient, or a ``trust vector''.

In the case of the terrestrial communications network used in \cite{Guo11}, the observed metric set $X = {x_1,\dots,x_M}$ representing the measurements taken by each node of its neighbours at least interval, is defined as $X=[$packet loss rate, signal strength, data rate, delay, throughput$]$.
The trust vector is given as
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:grc}
  \theta_{k,j}^t = \frac{\min_k|a_{k,j}^t - g_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-g_j^t|}{|a_{k,j}^t-g_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-g_j^t|} \\
  \phi_{k,j}^t = \frac{\min_k|a_{k,j}^t - b_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-b_j^t|}{|a_{k,j}^t-b_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-b_j^t|} \notag 
\end{align}
%
where $a_{k,j}^t$ is the value of a observed metric $x_j$ for a given node $k$ at time $t$, $\rho$ is a distinguishing coefficient set to $0.5$, $g$ and $b$ are respectively the '``good'' and ``bad'' reference metric sequences from $\{a_{k,j}^t k=1,2\dots K\}$, e.g. $g_j=\max_k({a_{k,j}^t})$,  $b_j=\min_k({a_{k,j}^t})$ (where each metric is selected to be monotonically positive for trust assessment, e.g. higher throughput is always better). 

\subsection{PROSE: Whats the point}

Grey System Theory, by it's own authors admission, hasn't taken root in it's originally intended area of system modelling \cite{Liu11}.
However, given it's tentative application to MANET trust, taking a Grey approach on a per metric benefit has qualitative benefits that require investigation; the algebraic approach to uncertainty and the application of ``essential and non essential greyness'', whiteisation, and particularly grey buffer sequencing allow for the opportunity to generate continuous trust assessments from multiple domains asynchronously;

For a given metric set $X$ such that $X = {x_1,\dots,x_M}$ representing the $M$ different types of measurement generated by an observer. If these metrics are not synchronised, for instance if they are interrupt driven such as communications-based observations, generating more abstract measurements requires inherent assumptions about ``how to accumulate the data while you wait''. For instance, in \cite{Bolster2015}, we demonstrated a periodic trust assessment framework for autonomous marine environments, in such an environment, to establish useful, generalised, data, it was necessary to wait for a relatively long time to accumulate enough data to make assessments.
However, this left many 'smells'; data was being left in-buffer for a long time before being used to make decisions, and by the time the data was collated and processed, it could be wildly different from the reality. Further, while some periods could be extremely sparse or even empty, others could be extremely busy with many records having to be averaged down to provide a 'single period' response. 
Therefore, the implementation of a suitable sequence buffer version of the framework would be beneficial.

Such a sequence buffer framework would involve a tracking predictor that would provide best-guess estimates of an interpolated value for a metric between value updates, and a back-propagation algorithm to retroactively update historical assessments of that metrics so as to better inform any abstracted trust value predictor.

I had initially thought that such a back-propogator would be a total mess as I'd imagined that significant-model-breaking would potetially indicate untrustworthy behaviour, but this is stupid since the per-metric-model has the least information of anyone and is simply there to provide better intermediate values and has no / limited direct impact on the overall trust behaviour. 

This backpropogation will probably be a pain to implement as it'd require a retroactive reassessment of trust and could get really messy if it was interrupt driven, but it's better not to prematurly optimise.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
