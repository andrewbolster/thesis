\section{Contributions and Findings}

\section{Future Work}
From \autoref{ch:comms_trust}:
One solution to this would be to move from a stepping-window of trust observations to a continuous trust log, updated on packet reception rather than waiting regular periods for packets to be analysed.
Future work could investigate the improvement of weight-based detection algorithms, the stability of \gls{gra} under multi-node collusion, the development of real-time outlier detection.
