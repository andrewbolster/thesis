\section{Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs)

With the explosive growth in the use of mobile telephony and the increasing miniturisation and efficiency gains of portable communications devices, the classical paradigm of a broadcast/reciever or server/client has given way to an increasing use of decentralised, ad-hoc networks that not only accomodate but take advantage of user mobility.

Wether these networks are decentralised cellular / RF / 802.11 WiFi networks for use in disaster relief areas \cite{Milliken2015} or biologically inspired wireless sensor networks for low-energy, low-maintence environmental monitoring \cite{Bhargavi2015}, MANET theory developed over the past 30 years has gone from it's first formal definition, emerging from DARPA's Packet Radio Network research\cite{Jubin1987}, to being an integral part of modern practical communications.
