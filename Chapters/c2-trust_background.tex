In this chapter we explore the current literature and research around the concepts, theory, and application around Trust and Trust Management, specifically leaning towards the applications of Trust within Autonomous \glspl{manet}.

In the first section, the generic operations and background to Autonomy and ``Trusted Operation'' from a user/operators perspective is investigated. 
In the second section, the abstract quantity of ``Trust'' is explored.
In the third section, current use and applications of Trusted operation of \glspl{manet} is explored, including current \glspl{tmf}.


\section{Trust Definitions and Perspectives}

For a term that is so common in every-day speech, Trust is a challenging discussion area, particularly given the wealth of proposed definitions (Table~\ref{tab:trust_definitions})\todo{More of these in the bookmarks list}.
Beyond these dry, vague, and often ``fuzzy'' definitions, there is a significant ontological conflict between the subjective and objective perspectives of trust; is ``trust'' an attribute of the actor performing a given action, or of the observer of such an action? Or indeed is trust itself an action upon a relationship between actors? Is it qualitative or quantitative? These questions have challenged philosophers, psychologists and social scientists for decades.

In human trust relationships it is recognized that there can be several domains of Trust for example organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological and neurological \cite{Lee2004}.

These domains of trust are, from a human perspective, quite natural and are formed during the earliest stages of linguistic integration.
This leads to recognisable deviations in the experiential concept of ``trust'' across cultures with differing linguistic histories.
This has led to a wealth of work in the social sciences (as well as management schools across the world) in to how to develop, understand, and repair trust across cultural boundaries.\cite{Okumura2011} \todo{Get more citations for this paragraph, need background on multicultural definitions rather than second hand}

As such it is important to explore the following areas of Trust definition before approaching the application of Trust towards Autonomous Systems and finally to \gls{manet}s:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definitions of Trust
  \item Modelling and Analysis of Trust Relationships
  \item 
\end{enumerate}

  \caption{Definitions of Trust}

  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Modelling of Trust Relationships}
Mayer et al \cite{Mayer1995} proposed a model of trust that encapsulates generalised factors of perceived trustworthiness in interpersonal relationships (Table~\ref{tab:trust_factors}), accommodating a subjective trustworthiness and risk-taking potentiality on the part of the trustor.
This formulation of trust allowed a wider discussion of the characteristics of trust relationships, both between individuals and within networks or communities.

\begin{table}\centering
  \caption[Factors of Trust]{Factors of Trust\cite{Mayer1995}}

  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{2cm}X}\toprule
    Factor & Definition \\ \midrule
    Ability & Collection of skills, competencies, capabilities and characteristics that enable a party to have influence or action within some specific domain \\
    Benevolence & The extent to which a trustee is believed to want to do good to or by the trustor beyond a selfish profit motive\\
    Integrity & Acceptance or adherence to a common set of principals of operation that the trustor finds acceptable\\
    \bottomrule

Lee and See \cite{Lee2004} extended and synthesised Mayer et al's approach to personal and interpersonal trust towards a generalised concept of trust for human and autonomic/autonomous systems with the following alternative contextual definitions (including their approximate mappings to Mayer et al's approach

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}


\subsection{Characteristics of Trust Relationships}

There are five commonly considered characteristics or attributes of Trust relationships in general, but not all relationships exhibit them and they are not assumed to be a complete specification of Trust:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Multi-Party} - One-to-one; one-to-many; many-to-one; many-to-many.
    Trust is not an absolute characteristic of a lone individual.
    Trust may include multi-agent abstractions (one-to-many), such as a preferential trust/distrust towards a group exhibiting a particular attribute, e.g.\ members of the armed forces / police services.
    Likewise, there can be trustor/trustee attributes that can generalise relationships between collectives (many-to-many), e.g.\ Jets and Sharks
  \item \emph{Transitive} - Trust assessments can be shared (i.e.\ recommendations), where this second order trust assessment incorporates both the observed trustworthiness of the trustee, as well as the trustworthiness of the intermediate trustor.
    In some models this is further extended to include out-of-network intermediate trustors that have some other defined authority, e.g.\ PKI Certificate Authority
  \item \emph{Evidential} - Trust must be based on some form of evidence-based observation or assessment, such as historical success rates of performing a certain action, or second-hand observations of trust from a third party.
  \item \emph{Directional Asymmetry} - The majority of relationships are bi-directional but are asymmetric, i.e.\ between two entities who ``trust'' each other, there are two independent trust relationships that may have very different ``values'' or extents.
  \item \emph{Contextual} - Trust can be variable and loosely coupled between contexts with respect to the action being assessed or the environment within which the trustee is operating, e.g.
    Doctors are trusted to perform medical procedures but that trust may not improve their success at correctly wiring an electrical plug.
    However there are plenty of counter-examples to this, as from \cite{Mayer1995}, two of the three listed factors of trust are ``Benevolence'' and ``Integrity'' and are unrelated to the ability of a trustee to perform a particular action, so it is reasonable to make an initial assumption that if a trustee is being benevolent in one activity or context, that that benevolence \emph{should} extend to other contexts.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Topologies of Multi-Party Trust Networks}
\label{sec:trust_topologies}
Beyond the attributes or characteristics of an individual trust relationship, within any multi party sparsely connected network or community, topological context is useful in both establishing trust and in disseminating observations for collaborative assessment.

Within sparsly connected networks, there are three primary types of relationship, minimally demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:trust_topology_relationships};

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Direct} - Whereby two nodes have a zero-hop communications link between them ($A,B,C$ in the given figure)
  \item \emph{Indirect} - Where two nodes have a $n>1$ hop communications link ($E,D$ from $A$ or $C$s perspective in the given figure)
  \item \emph{Recommendation} -  Where three nodes are fully connected so as to enable the exchange of direct opinions and form composite opinions based on the target and reporter (i.e.\ $A$ may have both its own Direct assessment of $C$, as well as it's knowledge of $B$s Direct assessment of $C$)
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{trust_topology_relationships}
  \caption{Trust Topologies, Direct, Indirect, Recommender, etc. from the perspective of Node A}
  \label{fig:trust_topology_relationships}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Levels of Trust}
\todo{This section may be superfluous}
Trust relationships operate as part of a system architecture, and can quite often get confused.
Sun\cite{Sun2008} suggests that within these there are two overarching forms of trust:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Behavioural: That one entity voluntarily depends on another entity in a specific situation
  \item Intentional: That one entity would be willing to depend on another entity
\end{itemize}
These concepts closely mirror the previous definitions of ‘Hard’ and ‘Soft’ trust respectively.
Behavioural Trust can be considered an invested dependency given certain parameters being satisfied, mirroring Hard Trust, and Intentional Trust can be considered as the ‘capacity for belief’ in another entity, analogous to Soft Trust.
It is suggested that these overarching forms are supported by and indeed are drawn from four major constructs within social and networked environments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Trusting Belief: the subjective belief within a system that the other trusted components are willing and able to act in each-others’ best interests
  \item Dispositional Trust: a general expectation of trustworthiness over time 
  \item Situational Decision Trust: in-situ risk assessment where the benefits of trust outweigh the negative outcomes of trust
  \item System Trust: the assurance that formal impersonal or procedural structures are in place to ensure successful operation.
\end{itemize}
Sun argues that only System Trust and Behavioural Trust are relevant to trusted networking applications.
However, it is arguable that in any network where the operation of that network is not the only concern, or where that network has to interact with any operator, then all of these factors come into play.
Both System and Behavioural trust rely on what Sun calls a ‘Belief Formation Process’, or a trust assessment, while the other trust constructs deal with the interactions between trust and decision making against an internal assessment of network trustworthiness.

\section{Trusted Development and Operation of Autonomous Systems}

\subsection{Introduction}

The aim of the section is to explore where trust is likely to impact \gls{sos} that contain autonomous elements incorporating Human Factors, Command and Control considerations, and \gls{v2v} distributed communication, from the perspective of trusted and semi-trusted operation.

This is a subject area with a great deal of complexity and touches on a wide range of research areas, so it will be discussed in four parts; 
 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Autonomy and Levels of Autonomy
  \item Trust as a Design Consideration for the Development of Autonomous Systems
  \item Operator / Organisational Factors relating to the Operation of Highly Autonomous Systems
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Autonomy and Levels of Autonomy}

Autonomy, like trust, is a nebulous, ill defined term across research, defense and commercial circles.
In the most general case, Autonomy is explained as the allocation of functionality between a system and an operator tasked with performing a given task; where a system is more``autonomous'', more of the sensing, planning, decision and action operations are performed by the system. (See Table~\ref{tab:autonomy_definitions} for a review of current definitions of autonomy and autonomous systems)

While Autonomy is largely taken to be a robotics term based in the case of one human operator and one robotic entity, recent advances in the development of more generalised cyber-physical systems has expanded this definition; from over-the-horizon human operation of \glspl{uav} to global networks of collaborating machines such as Google and beyond.

\subsection{Trust Perspectives in Autonomous Operation}
For the purposes of this work we define two perspectives on trust for autonomous systems: Design and Operational.
These are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:trust_perspectives}.
It is useful to further define and classify Operational Trust into two distinct but related sections defined in Table~\ref{tab:operational_trust_perspectives}.\todo{Work out how to reference across chapters in a multi doc}
\begin{table}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{3cm}X}\toprule
    \emph{Design Trust} & When an autonomous system is under development a level of Trust is established in it through the manner in which it has been designed and tested.
    This is the same as conventional systems.\par
    Given that systems that have high-levels of autonomy are designed to behave adaptively to dynamic environments, it is challenging to fully predict such non-deterministic behaviours prior to operational deployment.
    For example, in a navigation system it is difficult to predict the dynamic environment it will need to adapt to.\par
    Trust needs to be developed that the design and test of such systems are sufficient to predict that operation will be, if not optimal, at least satisfactory.
    \\
    \emph{Operational Trust} & Trust at runtime or in-situ that both the individual nodes within a system are operating as expected and that the interfaces between the operator and the system are as expected.
    \par
    This latter aspect covers issues such as physical/wireless links and interpretation of data at each end of such a communication link.
    Operational Trust is functionally derived from, but distinct from Design Trust.\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Trust Perspectives with respect to autonomous systems}
  \label{tab:trust_perspectives}
\end{table}
\begin{table}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{3cm}X}\toprule
    \emph{Hard Trust} or technical trust & The quantitative measurement and communication of the expectation of an actor performing a certain task, based on historic performance and through consensus building within a networked system.\par
    Can be thought of as a de-risking strategy to measure and monitor the ability of a system, or another actor within a system, to perform a task unsupervised.\\
    \emph{Soft Trust} or common trust & The qualitative assessment of the ability of an actor to perform a task or operation consistently and reliably based on social or experiential factors.\par
    This is the ‘human’ form of trust and is the main motivational driver for the human-factors trust discussion in *OTHER CHAPTER*.\par
    Can be rephrased as the level of confidence an operator has in an actor to perform a task unsupervised.\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Trust Perspectives within Operational Trust}
  \label{tab:operational_trust_perspectives}
\end{table}

It is already clear that these two definitions are extremely close in their construction, but represent fundamentally different approaches to trust, one coming from a sociological perspective of person-to-person and person-to-group relationships from day to day life, and the other coming from a statistical or formal appraisal of an activity by a system.

We have already defined two trust perspectives when considering the design and operation of autonomous systems (Table~\ref{tab:trust_perspectives}).
Examples of roles that interact with a system from both of these trust perspectives are provided in Tables~\ref{tab:design_perspectives} and~\ref{tab:operational_perspectives}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{1.5in}|p{1.5in}|p{1.5in}|}
    \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Role}}\\
    \hline  & \textbf{Designer} & \textbf{Acquirer} & \textbf{Disposer} \\
    \hline  \textbf{Definition} & Responsible for developing the system & Responsible for acquisition of the system & Responsible for the disposal of a system.
    \\ 
    \hline  \textbf{Level} & Organisation & Organisation & Organisation \\ 
    \hline  \textbf{Perspective} 
    & The designer of an Autonomous System develops trust through the application of known and trusted tools to well understood problems (e.g.\ a well-defined requirement set) using competent and trusted staff.
    \par 
    The trust perspective therefore could be regarded as the \textbf{Design perspective}.

    & The Acquirer of a System develops trust through prior experience of the vendor and similar products.
    For any given product this is supplemented by the examination of engineering evidence provided by the Designer Organisation.
    \par
    Although there will be several trust aspects to the role, for the purposes of this paper this role can be seen as having a \textbf{Design perspective} since the Acquisition process needs to develop trust that the systems it is buying will be designed to be trustworthy in operation.

    & System disposal does not necessarily indicate destruction.

    Where assets are passed to 3rd parties (e.g.\ though sale) the disposer must be confident that the autonomous behaviour can be reduced (where necessary) to a known and acceptable level.\par 
    This perspective is therefore part of the \textbf{Design perspective} since there will be trust that (possibly advanced) behaviours can be prevented from being passed unwittingly to second user organisations; particularly since they may use the systems in a different context.

    When interacting with a deployed system, the ongoing trust is maintained through correct and understandable system behaviour.
    This can be regarded as \textbf{Operational Trust }
    & A user of a System’s capability may not have any knowledge of the System itself but will need to develop trust in ability to provide trustworthy services.
    Again, this may be regarded as a form of \textbf{Operational Trust} \\

\end{table}

\subsection{Design Trust}

Five aspects of Design Trust have been identified: \todo{by whom}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Formal Specification of Dynamic Operation}: Autonomous Systems (AS) may be required to operate in complex, uncertain environments and as such their specification may need to reflect an ability to deal with unspecified circumstances.
    This includes engaging with dynamic systems of systems environments where an autonomous system may cooperate with a system not envisaged at design time.
    \textit{How can systems that are required to demonstrate that they meet their requirement be specified flexibly enough to permit adaptive behaviours}?
  \item \textbf{Security}: Any unmanned system has the potential to be used for illegitimate purposes by unscrupulous 3rd parties who could exploit security vulnerabilities to gain control of the system or sub-systems.
    Any system that has the potential to cause harm from such actions must have security designed in from the start to ensure that the system can be trusted to be resilient from cyber attack.
    Current accreditation schemes rely on a security assessment of a known architecture and there are mutual accreditation recognition schemes that could be encoded in dynamic discovery handshake protocols.
    This would produce a secure network assured through the accreditation of its component systems.
    For example, the Multinational Security Accreditation Board (MSAB) deals with Combined Communications Electronics Board (CCEB) and NATO Accreditations to provide security assurance of internationally connected networks.
    Encoding such agreements into secure handshakes could enable dynamic accreditation of autonomous systems cooperating in a coalition environment.
    It is not known whether these have been demonstrated, so the question is: \textit{Can autonomous systems be designed to understand the security situation when interfacing with known or unknown systems?}
  \item \textbf{Verification and Validation of a Flexible Specification}: Following on from the description of a flexible specification, establish that the AS conforms and performs in accordance to the specification.
    This has direct implication for the trust in the resultant system.
    How can systems demonstrate that they will behave acceptably when the environment is unknown?
  \item \textbf{Trust Modelling and Metrics}: This could be argued as part of the Verification and Validation of the system.
    However, models are increasingly being embedded into system design as a reference.
    Thus it is useful to consider this element separately.
    \textit{How can trust be modelled sufficiently to span the space of most potential behaviours to help ensure that systems will be trusted when moved into operational environments?
    Can this be measured to allow comparison and minimum requirements set?}
  \item \textbf{Certification}: The certification requirements placed on specific systems will vary depending on domain and national approaches to certification.
    However, the common element in the requirement for certification is that a certified system is deemed as sufficiently trustworthy for use within its context of certification.
    Additionally Certification also relies on the predictability of a system.
    Because the aim of autonomous systems is to deal effectively with uncertain environments, \textit{can they (autonomous systems) be certified without being demonstrated in the environment within which they will adapt new behaviour?}
\end{enumerate}

Clearly, compliance with existing military and commercial standards can play a significant role in demonstrating the trustworthiness of any systems’ design.
If a system has been designed to a Standard then it has known properties that have been accepted as good practice.
However, these do not address the issue of the five areas listed above.
The following sub section briefly outlines existing Standards for context.

There are three main organisations that are developing or have developed assurance standards for Unmanned Systems in commercial, civil and military applications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item NATO Standardization Office (NSO)
  \item Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
  \item American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{NATO Standardization Office}

Faced with the growing adoption of similar but disparate \gls{uav} systems within NATO territories and coalition nations, STANAG 4586\cite{STANAG4586} was promulgated in 2005 and defined a logistic and interoperability framework to provide commonality in the command and comtrol architecture and implementations of \gls{uav}/Ground station communications.

This included a particularly interesting development in the form of "Vehicle Specific Module" (VSM) interoperability, whereby existing systems could be grandfathered into 4586 compliance by the addition of a VSM to operate as a protocol translator.
This VSM could be mounted on the remote system, utilising a 4586 compliant Data Link Interface (DLI), or mounted on the UCS utilising a proprietary DLI to the remote system.
4586 described five \gls{loi} for compliant \gls{uav} systems, shown in Table~\ref{tab:levels_of_interoperability}.
This structure has been criticised as being short sighted and at odds with the reality of modern and proposed autonomous vehicle operations \cite{Cummings2010}, specifically that in modern autonomous systems, there is no such thing as ‘direct control’ or ‘Operator-in-the-loop’, especially in the case of \gls{blos} systems, and that in increasingly autonomous systems, operation is done as \gls{hsc}, or more commonly described as ‘Operator-on-the-loop’, whereby the operator interacts with the intermediate autonomous system and that autonomous system eventually performs that task on the hardware.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
    \hline  LOI &  \\ 
    \hline  1 &  Indirect receipt/transmission of \gls{uav} related payload data\\ 
    \hline  2 &  Direct receipt of \gls{isr} data where “direct” covers reception of \gls{uav} payload data by the UCS when it has direct communication with the \gls{uav}\\ 
    \hline  3 &  Control and monitoring of the \gls{uav} payload in addition to direct receipt of \gls{isr}/other data\\ 
    \hline  4 &  Control and monitoring of the \gls{uav}, less launch and recovery\\
    \hline  5 &  Launch and Recovery in addition to \gls{loi} 4\\ 
    \hline 
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Levels of Interoperability for STANAG 4586 Compliant UCS}
  \label{tab:levels_of_interoperability}
\end{table}

\todo{SAE Levels of Autonomy possibly from \cite{Beer2014}}

Further, 4586 predominantly deals with a one-to-one mapping between operators and nodes, when this is quite against the current state of the art; greater focus is being made in collective and collaborative assignment and having a single operating agent managing a group of autonomous nodes in-field, and handing off vehicle management responsibilities to the individual nodes.

\subsubsection{Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)}

The AS-4 steering group is responsible for the development and maintenance of the \gls{jaus} standards, which provide several service sets for Inter-System cooperation and interoperability, either in the form of a specified design language (JSIDL\footnote{\gls{jaus} Service Interface Definition Language}) or as a direct framework implementation, such as the \gls{jaus} Mobility, Mission Spooling, Environment Sensing, or Manipulator Service Sets\footnote{SAE AS6009, AS 6062, AS 6060, and AS 6057 respectively}.
This provides a stack-like interoperability model akin to the OSI inter-networking standard, providing logical connections between common levels across devices regardless of how subordinate layers are implemented.
Importantly, \gls{jaus} service models are open-sourced under the BSD-license, and a development toolkit is available for anyone to develop \gls{jaus}-compatible communications and control protocols\cite{JTS}.

It is also important to note that \gls{jaus} is part funded, and heavily utilised by, US Army and Marine Robotic Systems Joint Project Office (RS-JPO), which manage the development, testing, and fielding of unmanned (ground) systems for those respective forces.
This includes now legacy M160 mine clearance platform and the highly popular (both with forces and their in-field operators) iRobot Packbot inspection and \gls{eod} family of robotic platforms.

\subsubsection{American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM)}

The ASTM F38 committee has developed a \gls{los}, single-asset-single-operator stove-piped framework for Unmanned Air Systems that is too constrained in scope for applicability to a more heterogeneous operating environment\cite{AmericanSocietyofTestingandMaterials2007}.
However, the F41 Committee, focused on \glspl{umvs} has collectively developed a range of interoperable standards, covering Communications, Autonomy and Control, Sensor Data Formats, and Mission Payload Interfacing.
Of particular interest is the Autonomy and Control standard \cite{AmericanSocietyofTestingandMaterials2006}, which highlighted a requirement on the vehicle system to be able to recognise an authorised client, be that a human operator or an additional collaborating vehicle.
Further, the standard states that the responsibility of the safety and integrity of any payload remains with the vehicle.
This standard was withdrawn in 2015 due to ASTM regulations requiring standards to be updated within 8 years of approval, and has no direct replacement within ASTM, but stands as a useful guiding perspective on autonomy standards within industry.

\subsection{Human Factors related to Operational Trust}

This work is considering autonomous systems as entities of wider systems, we refer to these here as \glspl{acs}.
As described earlier, Operational Trust has two main aspects, trust in the system to behave as expected and trust in the interfaces between systems (human/machine and machine/machine).
Of all of the interfaces in an Autonomous Collaborative System, the most problematic is that arguably that between the System of Autonomous Systems (SoAS) and the human operator / team of operators.
Cummings identified the main challenges to \gls{hsc}, summarised below:\cite{Cummings2010}

\subsubsection{Information Overload}
Operator efficiency exhibits an optimum at moderate levels of cognitive engagement, above which cognitive ability is overloaded and performance drops (Otherwise known as the Yerkes-Dodson Law).
Additionally, in the case of under-engagement, operators can fall foul of boredom, and become desensitised to changing factors.
\textit{However, predicting this point of over-saturation is an open psychophysiological research problem.}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Automation}
Automation is well tailored to consistent levels of activity.
This is quite simply not the case many domains.
Particularly in defence and military applications, activity is characterised by long periods of ``routine'' punctuated by high intensity, usually unpredictable, activity.
At those interfaces between ``calm'' and ``storm'', where real time situational awareness is imperative, temporary Information Overload is highly probable.
Adaptive Automation enables autonomous systems to increase their \gls{loa} based on specific events in the task environment, changes in operator performance or task loading, or physiological methods.
It is taken as given that for routine operations, and increased \gls{loa} reduces operator workload, and vice versa.
However, this relationship is highly task dependent and can create severe problems in cases of \gls{loa} being greater, or indeed lesser, than is required.
In the cases of overly-high \gls{loa}, operator skill is degraded, situational awareness is reduced as the operator is not as engaged, and the automated system may not be able to handle unexpected events, requiring the operator to take over, which, given the previous points, is a difficult prospect.
Alternatively, in sub-optimal \gls{loa}, Information Overload can result in the case of high intensity situations, but also the system can fall foul of overly-sensitive human cognitive biases, false positive pattern detection, boredom, and complacency in the case where less is going on.
Therefore, as a corollary to Information Overload challenges, there is a need to define the interrelationship between levels of situational activity (or risk) and appropriate levels of automation.
\textit{Under what circumstances can AA be used to change the \gls{loa} of a system?
Does the autonomous system or the human decide to change \gls{loa}\@? 
What \gls{loa}s are appropriate for what circumstances?}

\subsubsection{Distributed Decision Making}
In a modern, non-hierarchical, often distributed or cellular military management system (Network Centric Warfare doctrine for example), tools are increasingly being used to mitigate information asymmetry within command and control.
A simple example of this is shared watch-logs in Naval operations, providing temporal collaboration between watch-teams separated in time.
The DoD Global Information Grid is another example of a spatial collaborative framework.
Recent work has demonstrated the power of collaborative analysis and human-machine shared sensing technologies even with low levels of training on the part of the operators providing superior results and resource efficiencies than either humans or machines alone in survey and search-and-rescue scenarios (Ahmed et al.2014)\todo{Check Security}.
As these temporal and spatial collaboration tools increase in complexity and ability, decisions that previously required SA that was only available at higher echelons within the standard hierarchy are available to commanders on the ground, or even to individual team members, enabling the potential for informed decisions to be taken faster and more effectively, enabled by automated strategies to present relevant information to teams based on the operational context.
However there are a range of operational, legal, psychological and technical challenges that need to be addressed before confidence in these distributed management structures can be established.
Studies into situational awareness sharing techniques (telepresent table-top environments, video conferencing, and interactive whiteboards) have generally yielded positive results, however investigations into interruptive-communications (such as instant messaging chat) have demonstrated a negative impact on operational efficiency.
In short, the biggest problem with distributed decision making in the context of supervisory systems is that \textit{there is no consensus on whether it is advantageous or not, and what magnitude of operational delta is introduced, if any.}

\subsubsection{Complexity}
Beyond simple Information Overload, increasing complexity of information presented to operators is having a negative effect on operational efficiency.
In HSC, displays are designed to reduce complexity, introducing abstractions with an aim to presenting the minimum amount of information to the operator required to maintain an accurate and up-to-date mental model of the environmental and operational state.
This has led to the development of many domain specific decision support interfaces, however, in academic research, there has been nothing but ‘mixed results’.
One commonly raised negative is the general bias on the ‘cool factor’ of interfaces.
Immersive 3D visual, aural, or haptic interfaces that at first appraisal seem to provide more approachable information to the operator, and are indeed tacitly preferred by operators in use.
However, there has not been any evidence to demonstrate performance improvement when using these tools, and in-fact, \textit{improving the ``fidelity'' of the interfaces has led to operators’ overly-relying on these representations of the environment rather than remaining engaged in the environment.}

\subsubsection{Cognitive Biases and Failing Heuristics}
In many areas, operators and commanders are required to make rapid decisions with imperfect information, driven by massively increased information availability and rates of change in areas such as battlefield tactics and global finance markets.
However, Human decision making isn’t always rational (especially under pressure), and operators use personally derived heuristics to make ``rational shortcuts''.
This is a double edged sword, where these heuristics can be employed to greatly reduce the normative cognitive load in a stressful situation, but also introduce destructive biases, where these shortcuts make assumptions that don’t bear out in reality.

For example, in the context of decision support systems, ``Autonomy Bias'' has been observed as a complement to the already well known ``Confirmation Bias''\footnote{Confirmation Bias is the tendency for people to preferentially select from available information that information that supports pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses.}  and ``Assimilation Bias''\footnote{Assimilation Bias is often thought of as a subset of Confirmation Bias, whereby it specifies that instead of seeking out information supporting of current views, any incoming data is interpreted as being supportive of a particular view without questioning that view, even if it appears contradictory.}, where operators that have been provided with a ``correct'' answer by a decision support system do not look (or see, depending on perspective) for any contradictory information, and will unquestionably follow, increasing error rates significantly.

This behaviour isn't only the reserve of decision support systems, but also in the generic allocation of operator attention; scheduling heuristics are used to decide how much time tasks should be worked on, and time and again, humans are found to be far from optimal in this regard, especially in time-pressured scenarios where these heuristics are in even more demand.
Even when operators are given optimal scheduling rules, these quickly fall apart, often due to primary task efficiency degradation after interruption.
This highlights a critical interface in the adoption of complex autonomous systems that still demand ‘Man in the loop’ functionality; if a system is required to have full-time concentrated supervision (e.g.\ flying a UCAV), but also event-based reactive decision making (e.g.\ alerts from non-critical subsystems), both tasks are negatively impacted.
In an assessment of factors influencing trust in autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis support systems, Carlson et al also identified that a major factor in an operator or users’ trust in a system was not only dependant on past performance and current accuracy but also on ``soft factors'' such as the branding and reputation of the manufacture / designer.(Carlson et al. 2014)\todo{Check Security}
Further, autonomous decision support / detection / classification systems have an ``uncanny valley'' to overcome in terms of accuracy, in that there is a dangerous period when such systems are used but not perfect, but operators become complacent, causing an increased error rate, until such a time that those autonomous systems can match or exceed the detection rates of their human counterparts.

\subsubsection{Summary of Human Factors impacting Operational Trust in Defence Contexts}

When dealing with human supervision of autonomous or semi-autonomous systems, there is an inherent conflict between the expectations of the operator, the hopes of system architects.
System Architects aim to provide more and more information to the operator to justify a systems operation, and Operators in reality need less and less information to be efficient when things are going well, and responsive in a dynamic environment.
This places huge demands on Human Interface design and indeed on communications design to provide this timely, relevant, interactive connection between any autonomous system and the end operator(s).
Recent work has presented the idea of taking user interface (UI) inspiration from the entertainment sector, in terms of UI best practises developed over two decades of Real-Time Strategy game development \cite{Johnson2007}, and follow up work into automated mission debrief demonstrated that such operational support could improve causal situational awareness of an operator when compared to a human-baseline \cite{Johnson2011}.
In terms of the human factors challenges raised by Cummings, they are often contradictory in their direction, particularly when contrasting between Adaptive Automation and Cognitive Biases challenges.
This is a key part of the ``soft trust'' perspective, where the operators and commanders need to be able to implicitly and explicitly trust the operation of a remote system with limited feed-back bandwidth, high latency, or long-term operation such that direct remote operation is infeasible or undesirable.
To be able to trust that systems’ ability to continue on a course, survey an area, notify on detection of an anomaly, etc.is going to be the corner stone of any autonomous systems justification in the future.

\subsection{Conclusions}

\todo{ReDo this later}

The implications of trust in autonomy beyond securing communications and data are an area in need of further research (BAE Systems, 2013. Maritime Autonomy Final Report - Combined Response,)\todo{Need to check security status of this source}
Of particular concern is the verification of autonomous behaviours.
Technology Readiness Level deficiencies were identified in the Maritime Capability Contribution of Unmanned Systems (MCCUS) Osprey Phase 1 report(Clark, H. et al., 2012. Maritime Capability Contribution of Unmanned Systems,)\todo{Need to check security status of this source}, with a particular focus on failsafe behaviour.
The addition of increased on-board autonomy in MUxS, properly understood and verified, would greatly improve this future capability, similar to recent developments in the UAS arena\cite{Cummings2010}.

There are opportunities for increased decentralisation and in-field collaboration(Walton, R., 2012. Maritime Autonomy PDR Pack.)\todo{Need to check security status of this source}, however, difficulties in “Trust” between human operators and autonomous systems have already been clearly identified\cite{Chen2011b},and this has been demonstrated by the recent decision by the German government to renege on its €500M investment in the Euro Hawk programme, due to concerns about civil certification of the onboard autonomy\cite{Mehta2013}
In order for these new distributed structures to be relied upon to provide operational performance, reliability and to maintain in-field situational awareness, vulnerabilities to disruption, interruption, and subversion need to be understood and minimised.


\section{Trust in \glspl{manet}}

\subsection{Trust Model Design Considerations}

From the previous sections, we define Trust as ``the level of confidence one agent has in another to perform a given action on request or in a certain context''.
Trust in the autonomous or semi-autonomous realm is the ability of a system to establish and maintain confidence in itself or another systems' operations.
There are five topics that are important to address in any \gls{manet}s trust model \cite{Kamvar2003}:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item The trust model should be without infrastructure.
    Because the network routing infrastructure is formed in an ad-hoc fashion, the trust management can not depend on, e.g., a trusted third party (TTP).
    There is no \gls{pki}, where some center nodes monitor the network, and publish illegal nodes periodically.
    In a \gls{manet}, there are no certification authorities (CA) or registration authorities (RA) with elevated privileges etc.
  \item The trust model should be anonymous because of the anonymity of mobile nodes in \gls{manet}s.
  \item The trust model should be robust.
    That is, it can be robust to all kinds of unfriendly attacks and the network itself should not be susceptible to attacks by unfriendly nodes.
    Moreover, in the presence of malicious nodes, they may attempt to subvert the model in order to get the unfairly good trust value.
  \item The trust model should have minimal control overhead in accordance with computation, storage, and complexity.
  \item The trust model should be self-organized.
    \glspl{manet} are characterized to have dynamic, random, rapidly changing and multi-hop topologies composed of variably bandwidth-constrained links
\end{itemize}
%

\subsection{Attacks on \glspl{manet}}



\subsection{Trust Management Frameworks}\label{sec:c2_tmfs}

Distributed trust management frameworks for \gls{manet}s aim to detect, identify, and mitigate the impacts of malicious actors by distributing per-node assessments and opinions to collectively self-police behaviour.

This predictive behaviour attempts to solve four important problems (paraphrased from \cite{Sun2008}):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Decision support} - For example; making informed routing table decisions based on past successes/failures.
  \item \emph{Adaptability} - Ongoing prediciction of the networks future trust states directly detemines the risk faced by the network. Internalised knowledge of the expected risk can aid in selecting appropriate measures/ countermeasures such as automatically varying the level of authentication required for network activities.
  \item \emph{Misbehaviour Detection} - Trust evaluation leads to a the natural policy that highly variable or low-trust nodes within a network should be subject to higher scrutiny; triggering this response indicates that a node is damaged or misbehaving.
  \item \emph{Abstraction of Collective security characteristics} - Through per-node trust evaluation, the generalised trustworthiness of a set or subset of nodes can be derived to encapsulate the ``health'' of the network as a whole.
\end{itemize}


Various models and algorithms for describing trust and developing trust management in distributed systems, P2P communities or wireless networks have been considered.
Taking some examples;
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Hermes Trust Establishment Framework} takes a Bayesian Beta function to model per-link \gls{plr} over time, combining ``Trust'' and ``Confidence of Assessment'' into a single value \cite{Zouridaki2005}.
  \item \emph{\acrfull{otmf}} takes a Bayesian approach and introduces the idea of applying a Beta function to changes in the per-link \gls{plr} over time, combining ``Trust'' and ``Confidence of Assessment'' into a single value \cite{Li2008}.
    \gls{otmf} however does not appropriately combat multi-node-collusion in the network \cite{Cho2011}.
  \item \emph{Trust-based Secure Routing \cite{Moe2008a}} demonstrated an extension to Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), incorporating a Hidden Markov Model of the wider ad-hoc network, reducing the efficacy of Byzantine attacks, particularly black-hole attacks but is limited by focusing on single metric observation (\gls{plr})\cite{Cho2011}.
  \item \emph{CONFIDANT}; \cite{Buchegger2002} presented an approach using a probabilistic estimation of normal observations, similar to \gls{otmf}.
    They also introduced a greedy topology weighting scheme that internally weighted incoming trust assessments based on historical experience of the reporter.
  \item \emph{Fuzzy Trust-Based Filtering}; \cite{Luo2008} presented a method using Fuzzy Inference to cope with imperfect or malicious recommendation based on a probabilistic estimation of performance using conditional similarity to classify performance using overlapping Fuzzy Set Membership functions to collaboratively filter reputations across a network.
  \item \emph{\gls{mtfm}} uses a number of communications metrics together for form a vector of trust, apply grey information theory to allow a system to detect and identify the tactics being used to undermine or subvert trust\cite{Guo11}
\end{itemize}
%

\subsection{Single Metric Trust Frameworks}

\todo{Expand background detail on more frameworks}
The Hermes trust establishment framework \cite{Zouridaki2005} uses Bayesian reasoning to generate a posterior distribution function of ``belief'', or trust, given a sequence of observations of that behaviour, $p(B|O)$\eqref{eq:otmf_pbo}.
%
\begin{equation}
  p(B|O)  = \frac{p(O|B) \times p(B)}{\rho}
  \label{eq:otmf_pbo}
\end{equation}
%
Where $p(B)$ is the prior probability density function for the expected normal behaviour, and $\rho$ is a normalising factor.

Due to it's flexibility and simplicity, Hermes assumes that $p(B)$ is a Beta function, and therefore the evaluation of this trust assessment is based around the expectation value of the distribution \eqref{eq:otmf_t}  where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ represent the number of successful and unsuccessful interactions respectively for a particular node $i$.

A secondary measurement of the confidence factor of the trust assessment $t$ is generated as \eqref{eq:otmf_c} and these measurements are combined to form a ``trustworthiness'' value $T$ \eqref{eq:otmf_trust}.
%
\begin{align}
  t_i &\to E\lbrack\text{beta}(p|\alpha,\beta)\rbrack = \frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_i+\beta_i} \label{eq:otmf_t}\\[5pt]
  c_i &= 1 - \sqrt{\frac{12\alpha_i\beta_i}{(\alpha_i+\beta_i)^2(\alpha_i+\beta_i+1)}} \label{eq:otmf_c}\\[5pt]
  T_i &= 1 - \frac{\sqrt{\frac{(t_i-1)^2}{x^2} + \frac{(c_i-1)^2}{y^2}}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{x^2}+\frac{1}{y^2}}} \label{eq:otmf_trust}
\end{align}
%
In \eqref{eq:otmf_trust}, $x$ and $y$ are constants, used weight the two-dimensional polar mapping of trust and confidence assessments ($t_i,c_i$), and from \cite{Zouridaki2005}, are taken as $x=\sqrt{2},y=\sqrt{9}$.

Upon this per-node assessment methodology, \gls{otmf} overlays an observation distribution protocol so as to make the measurements $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ representative of the direct and 1-hop networks observations of the target node $i$, as well as expiring old observations from assessment and eliminating observations from ``untrustworthy'' nodes.

\todo{Want at least CONFIDANT and Fuzzy in here for contrast}
To date this work has been mostly limited to terrestrial, RF based networks.
There are also situations where the observed metrics will include significant noise and occur at irregular, sparse, intervals.
Conventional approaches such as probabilistic estimation do not produce trust values that reflect the underlying reality and context of the metrics available, as they require a-priori assumption that the trust value under exploration has an expected distribution, that distribution is mono-modal, and the input metrics are binary.
In scenarios with variable, sparse, noisy metrics, estimating the distribution is difficult to accomplish a-priori.

Hermes, \gls{otmf}, CONFIDANT, and Fuzzy Trust-Based Filtering can be generalised as single-value probabilistic estimation, based on a Bayesian idea of taking a binary input state and generating an idealised Beta Distribution (\ref{eq:beta}) of the future states of that input generated through an expectation value based on interactions (\ref{eq:beta_e}).
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:beta}
  \text{beta}(p|\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}p^{\alpha-1},\text{where } 0 \leq p \leq 1; \alpha,\beta > 0\\
  \label{eq:beta_e}
  E(p) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}
\end{align}
%
Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ represent the number of successful and unsuccessful interactions respectively.

These single metric TMFs provide malicious actors with a significant advantage if their activity is undetectable by that one assessed metric, especially if the attacker is aware of the observed metric in advance.

The objective of operating a TMF is to increase the confidence in, and efficiency of, a system by reducing the amount of undetectable negative operations an attacker can perform.
In the case where the attacker can subvert the TMF, the metric under assessment by that TMF does not cover the threat mounted by the attacker.
In turn, this causes a super-linearly negative effect in the efficiency of the network as the TMF is assumed to have reduced the possible set of attacks when in fact it has only made it more advantageous to attack a different aspect of the networks operation.
An example of such a behaviour would be the case in a TMF focused on PLR where an attacker selectively delays packets going through it, reducing the over all throughput of one or more virtual network routes.
Such behaviour would not be detected by the TMF.

\subsection{Multi-Metric Trust Frameworks}\label{sec:multimetrictrust}
Given the potential incentives to a selfish attacker and potential threats to trust and fairness in sparse, noisy, and constrained environments, single metric trusts discussed above do not suitably cover the exposed threat surface.\todo{Probably best to just send a reference forward to the Marine Comms chapter}
A multi-metric approach may be more appropriate to capture and monitor the realities of harsh and sparse communications environments.

\gls{mtfm}\cite{Guo11} uses Grey Theory\cite{Zuo1995} to perform cohort based normalization of metrics at runtime, providing a ``grey relational grade'' of trust compared to other observed nodes in that interval for individual metrics, while maintaining the ability to reduce trust values down to a stable assessment range for decision support without requiring every environment entered into to be characterised.
This presents a stark difference between the Grey and Probabilistic approaches.
Grey assessments are relative in both fairly and unfairly operating networks.
All nodes will receive mid-range trust assessments if there are no malicious actors as there is nothing ``bad'' to compare against, and variations in assessment will be primarily driven by topological and environmental factors.
Guo et al.\cite{Guo11} demonstrated the ability of grey relational analysis (GRA) to normalise and combine disparate traits of a communications link such as instantaneous throughput, received signal strength, etc.\ into a grey relational coefficient (GRC), or a ``trust vector'' in this instance.

The grey relational vector is given as
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:grc}
  \theta_{k,j}^t = \frac{\min_k|a_{k,j}^t - g_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-g_j^t|}{|a_{k,j}^t-g_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-g_j^t|} \\
  \phi_{k,j}^t = \frac{\min_k|a_{k,j}^t - b_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-b_j^t|}{|a_{k,j}^t-b_j^t| + \rho \max_k|a_{k,j}^t-b_j^t|} \notag 
\end{align}
%
where $a_{k,j}^t$ is the value of an observed metric $x_j$ for a given node $k$ at time $t$, $\rho$ is a distinguishing coefficient set to $0.5$, $g$ and $b$ are respectively the ``good'' and ``bad'' reference metric sequences from $\{a_{k,j}^t k=1,2\dots K\}$, i.e.\ $g_j=\max_k({a_{k,j}^t})$,  $b_j=\min_k({a_{k,j}^t})$ (where each metric is selected to be monotonically positive for trust assessment, e.g.\ higher throughput is presumed to be always better).

Weighting can be applied before generating a scalar value \eqref{eq:metric_weighting} allowing the detection and classification of misbehaviours.

%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:metric_weighting}
  [\theta_k^t, \phi_k^t] = \left[\sum_{j=0}^M h_j \theta_{k,j}^t,\sum_{j=0}^M h_j \phi_{k,j}^t \right]
\end{equation}
%
Where $H=[h_0\dots h_M]$ is a metric weighting vector such that $\sum h_j = 1$, and in unweighted case, $H=[\frac{1}{M},\frac{1}{M}\dots\frac{1}{M}]$.
$\theta$ and $\phi$ are then scaled to $[0,1]$ using the mapping $y = 1.5 x - 0.5$.
To minimise the uncertainties of belonging to either best ($g$) or worst ($b$) sequences in \eqref{eq:grc} the $[\theta,\phi]$ values are reduced into a scalar trust value by $T_k^t = ({1+{(\phi_k^t)^2}/{(\theta_k^t)^2}})^{-1}$ \cite{Hong2010}.
\gls{mtfm} combines this GRA with a topology-aware weighting scheme \eqref{eq:networkeffects} and a fuzzy whitenization model \eqref{eq:whitenization}.

There are three classes of topological trust relationship used; Direct, Recommendation, and Indirect, repeating those discussed in section~\ref{sec:trust_topologies}.\todo{This is currently half empty}
Where an observing node $n_i$ assesses the trust of another target node, $n_j$; the Direct relationship is $n_i$'s own observations $n_j$'s behaviour.
In the Recommendation case, a node $n_k$ which shares Direct relationships with both $n_i$ and $n_j$, gives its assessment of $n_j$ to $n_i$.
In the Indirect case, similar to the Recommendation case, the recommender $n_k$ does not have a direct link with the observer $n_i$ but $n_k$ has a Direct link with the target node, $n_j$.
These relationships give node sets, $N_R$ and $N_I$ containing the nodes that have recommendation or indirect, relationships to the observing node respectively.
%
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:networkeffects}
  T_{i,j}^{\gls{mtfm}}=&\frac{1}{2} \cdot \max_s\{f_s(T_{i,j})\} T_{i,j}\\ \notag
  +&\frac{1}{2} \frac{2|N_R| }{2|N_R| + |N_I|}\sum_{n \in N_R} \max_s\{f_s(T_{i,n})\} T_{i,n}\\ \notag
  +&\frac{1}{2} \frac{|N_I| }{2|N_R| + |N_I|}\sum_{n \in N_I} \max_s\{f_s(T_{i,n})\} T_{i,n} 
\end{align}
Where $T_{i,n}$ is the subjective trust assessment of $n_i$ by $n_n$, and $f_s = [ f_1,f_2, f_3]$ given as:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:whitenization}
  f_1(x)&= -x+1\notag\\
  f_2(x)&= 
  \begin{cases}
    2x & \text{if }x\leq 0.5\\
    -2x+2 & \text{if }x>0.5
  \end{cases}\\
  f_3(x)&= x\notag
\end{align}
%
In the case of the terrestrial communications network used in \cite{Guo11}, the observed metric set $X = {x_1,\dots,x_M}$ representing the measurements taken by each node of its neighbours at least interval, is defined as $X=[$packet loss rate, signal strength, data rate, delay, throughput$]$.

Guo et al.\ demonstrated that when compared against \gls{otmf} and Hermes trust assessment, \gls{mtfm} provided increased variation in trust assessment over time, providing more information about the nodes' behaviours than packet delivery probability alone can.
\section{Conclusion}
As mobile ad-hoc networks (\gls{manet}s) grow beyond the terrestrial arena, their operation and the protocols designed around them must be reviewed to assess their suitability to different communications environments to ensure their continued security, reliability, and performance.
With demand for smaller, more decentralised \gls{manet} systems in a range of domains and applications, as well as a drive towards lower per-unit cost in all areas, TMFs are going to be increasingly applied to resource constrained applications, as the benefits and efficiencies they present are significant.
For the purposes of this work, we are concerned with the analytical establishment of hard trust within a topologically dynamic network of autonomous actors.
Beyond the constraints of the communications environment, knock on pressures in battery capacity, on-board processing, and locomotion simultaneously present opportunities and incentives for malicious or selfish actors to appear to cooperate while not reciprocating, in order to conserve power for instance.
These multiple aspects of potential incentives, trust, and fairness do not directly fall under the scope of single metric trusts discussed above, and this context indicates that a multi-metric approach may be more appropriate.
These increasingly decentralised applications present unique threats against trust management \cite{Caiti2011}.

One area of application is the underwater marine environment, where extreme challenges to communications present themselves (propagation delays, frequency dependent attenuation, fast and slow fading, refractive multipath distortion, etc.).
In addition to the communications challenges, other considerations such as command and control isolation, as well as power and locomotive limitations, drive towards the use of teams of smaller and cheaper \gls{auv} platforms.
In underwater environments, communications is both sparse and noisy.
Therefore the observations about the communications processes that are used to generate the trust metrics, occur much less frequently, with much greater error (noise) and delay than is experienced in terrestrial RF \gls{manet}S.

As such, the use of trust methods developed in the terrestrial \gls{manet} space should be reappraised for application within the underwater context \cite{Pavan2015}.

In the next chapter, the marine communications environment will be studied, as will the current state of the art in the use of autonomy in specifically defence related maritime applications.
