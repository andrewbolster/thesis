There are many people who deserve the highest thanks for their support, patience, kindness and understanding.
The greatest thanks have to be distributed among my family and friends, for putting up with my madness; including but not limited to the madness of starting it, the madness of following the project to a different city and institution mid way through, and the madness of seeing it through.
Maybe I'll get a job that can actually be explained! 
Finally, I must thank Professor Marshall, without whom this work wouldn't have been attempted let alone completed.
Any mistakes are his and he can be contacted on alan.marshall@liverpool.ac.uk for comments and corrections.
