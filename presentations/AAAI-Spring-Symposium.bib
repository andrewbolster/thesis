abstract = {Mobile ad-hoc networking works properly only if the participating nodes cooperate in routing and forwarding. However,it may be advantageous for individual nodes not to cooperate. We propose a protocol, called CONFIDANT, for making misbehavior unattractive; it is based on selective altruism and utilitarianism. It aims at detecting and isolating misbehaving nodes, thus making it unattractive to deny cooperation. Trust relationships and routing decisions are based on experienced, observed, or reported routing and forwarding behavior of other nodes. The detailed implementation of CONFIDANT in this paper assumes that the network layer is based on the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. We present a performance analysis of DSR fortified by CONFIDANT and compare it to regular defenseless DSR. It shows that a network with CONFIDANT and up to 60\% of misbehaving nodes behaves almost as well as a benign network, in sharp contrast to a defenseless network. All simulations have been implemented and performed in GloMoSim.},

@article{Liu2006,
abstract = {The performance of ad hoc networks depends on co-operation and trust among distributed nodes. To enhance security in ad hoc networks, it is important to evaluate trustworthiness of other nodes without centralized authorities. In this paper, we present an information theoretic framework to quantitatively measure trust and model trust propagation in ad hoc networks. In the proposed framework, trust is a measure of uncertainty with its value represented by entropy. We develop four Axioms that address the basic understanding of trust and the rules for trust propagation. Based on these axioms, we present two trust models: entropy-based model and probability-based model, which satisfy all the axioms. Techniques of trust establishment and trust update are presented to obtain trust values from observation. The proposed trust evaluation method and trust models are employed in ad hoc networks for secure ad hoc routing and malicious node detection. A distributed scheme is designed to acquire, maintain, and update trust records associated with the behaviors of nodes' forwarding packets and the behaviors of making recommendations about other nodes. Simulations show that the proposed trust evaluation system can significantly improve the network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks. 2006 IEEE.},

@article{Li2007a,
abstract = {In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), each node should not only work for itself, but should be cooperative with other nodes. Under such environment, some nodes may misbehave for individual interests. Currently two categories of trust management frameworks, reputation-based framework and trust establishment framework, are used to guarantee nodes to perform normal behavior. However, in reputation-based framework, it is unreasonable that only one parameter, trust value, is considered. Meanwhile, the trust establishment framework is vulnerable under the selective misbehavior attack, by which the attacker performs different behaviors to different nodes. To solve these problems, we propose an objective trust management framework (OTMF) for MANETs, by which one node evaluates the trustworthiness of another node objectively based not only on direct observations, but on second-hand information. To compare the OTMF with the existing frameworks, we provide performance evaluation. The evaluation results show that the OTMF can obtain more reliable trust than the reputation-based framework and can prevent the selective misbehavior attack more effectively than the trust establishment framework.},
