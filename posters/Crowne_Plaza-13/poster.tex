              \emph{Aim of project}: To use physical behaviours and observations to assess trust within a mobile, marine, ad-hoc networks without wasting communications time / energy

              \begin{itemize}
                \item Small fleets of AUVs (\emph{Autonomous Underwater Vehicles}) will be expected to operate in isolated environments.
                \item This requires an auditable sense of trust within the remote intra-fleet communications networks, incorporating
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item Communications Activity

                    \item Behavioural Monitoring
                  \end{itemize}
                \item The use of centrally coordinated trust models presents a single point of failure.
                \item Verifiably secure direct communications in marine environments are expensive and time consuming; adopting decentralised trust assurance will reduce these costs.\cite{Partan2006}

              \begin{itemize}
                \item This Behaviour monitoring is the subject of the current work and touches on many areas
                \begin{itemize}
                  \item Inter-vector communications in the Marine Environment
                  \item Trust and Reputation Modelling in Ad-Hoc Networks

              \begin{block}{Trust}
                  Trust is:
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item an assessment of the likelihood of action upon request
                    \item a belief on the reliability of an actor
                    \item based on both direct and indirect historical experience
                  \end{itemize}

                  Individual trust opinions are shared within the team concerning a range of activities:
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item Transmission Relaying (Local and/or Backhaul)
                    \item Position Relaying
                    \item Reporting Accuracy
                  \end{itemize}

                  \begin{figure}

                      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../../figures/trust_explanation.dot}

                  \end{figure}
                  \vspace{-1ex}
                  These Trust opinions also apply to extra-fleet actors, such as surface platforms, submarine comms links, and coastal stations, allowing the fleet to collaboratively form an opinion of these actors.                  
            \end{block}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
            \begin{block}{Behaviour}
              To develop a trust scheme based on operational behaviours, those behaviours must be investigated to assess what metrics to use for trust and reputation modelling. 

              \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

              Behaviours under investigation include:
              \begin{itemize}
                \item \emph{Waypointing} - Attraction to a point or a chain of points, providing pre-described patrol networks
                \item \emph{Surveying} - Fleets can be tasked to provide one-shot, or persistent coverage of an area of the environment
                \item \emph{Dynamic Constraint} - Repulsion from a series of points, analogous to sea-borders or shipping lanes.
              \end{itemize}

              \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

              Potentially Exploitable Behaviours not yet developed include:
              \begin{itemize}
                \item \emph{Capacity Based Homing} - A node can temporarily leave the fleet to refuel/resupply from a \emph{mothership} or friendly harbour
                \item \emph{Dynamic Communications Maintenance} - The fleet can adjust to changing communications environments by closing together in poor communications environments and expanding in good environments.
              \end{itemize}

              Bespoke Simulation framework consisting of three modules:
              \begin{itemize}
                \item \texttt{Aietes} : the original base behavioural simulator, performing agent-based modelling of the motions of AUV's within an 
                  environment
                \item \texttt{Bounos} : a collection of data processing and collation functions.
                \item \texttt{Ephyra} : a GUI visualisation (and later, control) system for both Aietes and Bounos (See Fig~\ref{fig:Ephyra})
                \item \texttt{Polybos} : a batch processing and statistics management system
              \end{itemize}

              \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

              It is highly flexible, allowing for:

                \item Arbitrary node configurations (both in terms of physical and communications capabilities)

                \item Support for runtime and \emph{a-posteriori} statistical analysis with numpy/scipy/pandas\cite{Others}
                \item Componentised Behaviour network, with a Boid-like collaborative control path base behaviour (flocking)\cite{Reynolds1987a}
                \item Integration to the SUNSET emulation platform, allowing for rapid integration to real equipment\cite{Petrioli2012a}

                \item Using simple misbehaviours to test the concept and investivate methods of detection; 
                \item Two generated misbehaviours selected for test, as well as a baseline normal behaviour (Chained-Waypoint tasking)
                  \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{Shadow} a rogue AUV following the fleet (and the fleet rules) without knowledge of the mission 
                    \item \textbf{SlowCoach} a rogue AUV actively otherwise aware of the mission but intending to slow it down
                  \end{itemize}
                \item Taking a selected metric (Inter Node Distance Deviation \emph{INDD}), it is shown that detection is possible and reliable.
                \item Additional related metrics such as the Inter Node Heading Deviation \emph{INHD} and the simple Speed of the nodes are not as consistent as \emph{INDD}, but can permit identification of a malicious node.
                \item All of the current metrics are real-time computed and require no \emph{a-priori} knowledge of the fleet, but require a high degree of 
                  accuracy in the positional and (hence) velocity spaces.

            \begin{block}{Analysis}
              Taking three simulated fleets in a simple patrol mission, two with a malicious node, and comparing the metrics of:
              \begin{itemize}
                \item \emph{INHD}: Inter Node Heading Deviation, or the per-node deviation from the fleet-average velocity vector
                \item \emph{Node Speed}: The Magnitude of Velocity of each node
                \item \emph{INDD}: Inter Node Distance Deviation, or the normalised deviation between the inter-node distance matrices from the perspective of each node
              \end{itemize}
              \begin{figure}
                \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/Behaviour Metric Comparison}
                \caption{Metric Comparison chart showing each metric (vertically) for each simulation run (horizontally) where the left-hand-side charts are have a malicious node (\textbf{Whiskey} in Shadow, \textbf{Victor} in SlowCoach). The black dashed lines represent the fleet-average value for each metric. Highlighted sections of the graph highlight Positive detections (Green) and False Positive Detections (Red). Blue Vertical Lines show Operational Task Achievement (Way-point Passing)}
                \label{fig:Behaviour Metric Comparison}
              \end{figure}
              
              \emph{INDD} is clearly an obvious candidate for a trust assessment metric, with clear, consistent detections and few false positives.

              \emph{INHD} is also a good candidate but is very susceptible to short \emph{bursty} false positives.

              \emph{Node Speed} is particularly interesting; comparing the SlowCoach behaviour and the Shadow behaviour (which are virtual identical in terms of basic visual and operational measurements), but show very different characteristics in the node speed, with \textbf{Victor} appearing quite often.

              \vspace{\baselineskip}

              It's clear that while detection is possible, identification of a particular malicious behaviour requires a heuristic analysis across metrics.
              This implies that a fusion of metrics would be more effective than a simple detection envelope on a single metric, clearly indicating the deviant nodes within the fleets.

            \begin{block}{Analysis Cont.}
              Looking at the Waypoint data (Centre of Figure ~\ref{fig:Behaviour Metric Comparison}), it's clear that these metrics are not perfect, as is demonstrated by the number of relatively short-lived false positives. However, the trust fusion disregards these short-lived pulses, resulting in clear indications of malicious or disruptive behaviour.

              \vspace{\baselineskip}

              Figure ~\ref{fig:Behaviour Fusion} demonstrates a simple un-weighted trust fusion, where deviations in individual metrics are additively combined to generate a coarse Trust Value. It's clear from the massive impact of \emph{INDD} on the fused value is a problem that needs to be solved, as not all potential misbehaviours will be so evident in this single metric.
            \end{block}
            \begin{block}{Future Work}
              \begin{itemize}
                \item PoC demonstrates that it is relatively simple to detect and identify misbehaving if an observer has all available data to a suitable degree 
                  of accuracy and timeliness
                \item Next steps are to develop a suite of misbehaviours and analyses to construct an agnostic trust framework, combining these 
                  multiple analysis metrics via Gray Theory so as to provide detection, discrimination, and identification of the full range of 
                  potential misbehaviour / failure states
                \item Once this framework is completed, the data-availability will be iteratively stripped back to approach the realistic communications and sensor environment, and the failure state of the framework will be assessed
              \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%
            \begin{block}{Future Applications}
              \begin{itemize}
                \item Due to the high communications, motion, and computation costs, and lack of external location reporting (\emph{e.g. GPS}), 
                  behavioural analysis in the marine environment is particularly difficult, but if successful, can be reliably applied in a wide 
                  variety of fields including but not limited to
                \begin{itemize}
                  \item Self-Driving Cars

            \begin{block}{Conclusions}
              This research area presents a range of challenges and opportunities within both civil and defence operations; an audit-able trust framework for automated marine craft would be a significant enabling factor to the roll-out of more low-maintenance or even ``Fire and Forget'' deployments for persistent patrol / monitoring tasks. 

              \vspace{\baselineskip}

              Related innovations in battery, propulsion, sensor and communications packages will enable small teams of AUVs to remain trusted even outside of in-field communications networks, and can even be used as a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) to expand the in-field network with low power communications. With the aid of introspective trust, these fleets will have a much greater awareness of their fitness, and thus provide greater security and robustness to attack.
