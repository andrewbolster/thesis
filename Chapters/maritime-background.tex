\section{Maritime Communications Environment}\label{sec:marine_comms}

The key challenges of underwater acoustic communications are centred around the impact of slow and differential propagation of energy (RF, Optical, Acoustic) through water, and it's interfaces with the seabed / air.
The resultant challenges include; long delays due to propagation, significant inter-symbol interference and Doppler spreading, fast and slow fading due to environmental effects (aquatic flora/fauna; surface weather), carrier-frequency dependent signal attenuation, multipath caused by the medium interfaces at the surface and seabed, variations in propagation speed due to depth dependant effects (salinity, temperature, pressure, gaseous concentrations and bubbling), and subsequent refractive spreading and lensing due to that same propagation variation\cite{Partan2006}.

\subsection{Mechanics of Acoustic Transmission}

Unlike in RF energy transfer (where photons move through space to transmit energy from one place to another), acoustic wages are the result of mechanical perturbation of a medium where localised compressions and extensions pass energy across a medium through that mediums elastic properties.
These ``compression waves'' propagate away from its source, and the rate of this propagation is the sound speed, velocity or $c$, measured in $ms^{-1}$.
This is not to be confused with the fluid velocity corresponding to the instantaneous motion of particles in the medium.

Hydrophones, like their more common microphone equivalent in air, are fundamentally pressure sensors.
Acoustic pressure is usually measured in \emph{Pascals} ($Pa/\mu Pa$). 
In the underwater environment, the dynamic range (difference between instantaneous high and low pressure values) may be extremely high, often more than 10 orders of magnitude higher. 
As such, logarithmic notation is justified.

Useful acoustic signals are generally maintained vibrations rather than instantaneous pulses.
They are characterised by their frequency $f$ expressed in Hertz ($Hz$) or by their Period ($T$) in seconds.
In commonly used underwater acoustics, used frequencies range from $\approx 10Hz-100kHz$ depending on application.\cite{Stojanovic2007}.

As with all waves, the relationship between frequency, period and the wavelength is given as in \eqref{eq:wavelength}. 
As such the generally used upper and lower bounds of wavelength in most applications is from $1.5 m @ 10Hz$ to $0.015m @ 100kHz$.
%
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = cT = \frac{c}{f}
  \label{eq:wavelength}
\end{equation}
%

This wide range of frequencies and wavelengths allow for a diverse set of constraining factors; (Paraphrased from \citet{lurton2010}).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Attenuation} in water; limiting the maximum usable range, which increases very rapidly with frequency
  \item \emph{Dimensions} of sound source; which increase at lower $f$ for a given transmission power
  \item \emph{Spatial Selectivity} of sources and receivers as $f$ increases, due to similarly increasing directivity of energy propagation.
  \item \emph{Acoustic Response} of target surfaces (analogous to receiver gain in RF networks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Velocity and density}

Air has a baseline density of approximately $1.3 kg m^{-3}$, and the speed of sound is typically static around $340 ms^{-1}$.
In sea water, acoustic wave velocity is close to $c=1500ms^{-1}$ (generally between $1450ms^{-1}$ and $1550ms^{-1}$ depending on temperature, pressure, salinity etc.).
Similarly variable is sea water density, which is nominally $\rho = 1030kg m^{-3}$.

While the sea/air surface is (ideally) a simple refractive interface, the interface between open seawater and marine sediment is graduated, with density ranges between $1200 - 2000 kg m^{-3}$. 
This results in refractive and reflective velocities in the sediment interface ranging from $1500-2000 ms^{-1}$\cite{lurton2010}.

For comparison, the speed of light in air/water is $2.99 \times 10^8 ms^{-1}$ and $2.249 \times 10^{8} ms^{-1}$ respectively. 
\todo{FIX:this might be better as a table}

\citet{Mackenzie1981} proposed a more accurate model of acoustic velocity incorporating archival data from 15 worldwide sites that takes Temperature, Salinity and Depth into consideration.

\begin{align}
  c = & 1448.96 + 4.591 T - 5.304 \times 10^{-2} T^2 + 2.374 \times 10^{-4}T^{3}\notag\\
  & +1.340 (S-35) + 1.630\times 10^{-2}D+1.675\times 10^{-7}D^2\\
  & -1.025 \times 10^{-2}T(S-25) - 7.139\times 10^{-13}TD^3\notag
  \label{equ:mackenzie}
\end{align}

Where $T$ is the temperature in Celsius, $S$ the salinity in parts per thousand, and $D$ is the depth below the surface in meters.

These are ``ideal'' assessments, and the parameters of this model are massively varied both across individual water columns, and indeed across bodies of water, across the world. 
\gls{noaa} regularly publish their \gls{woa}\cite{Locarnini2013,Zweng2013} that includes these variables and many more, sampled across the world and at a range of depths.

\subsection{Intensity and Power} 

The energy of an acoustic wave is encapsulated into its kinetic and potential parts; where its kinetic energy corresponds to the active motion energy of the particles in the medium, and the potential energy corresponding to the elastic potential of the medium in displacement/compression.

The acoustic intensity ($I$) is the energy flux mean value per unit of surface and time \eqref{eq:acoustic_intensity} in Watts/$m^2$ where $p_0$ is the plane wave amplitude (pressure) and $P_{rms} = p_0/\sqrt{2}$

\begin{equation}
  I = \frac{p_0^2}{2\rho c} = \frac{p_{rms}^2}{\rho c}
  \label{eq:acoustic_intensity}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Attenuation}

The attenuation that occurs in an underwater acoustic channel over a distance $d$ for a signal about frequency $f$ in linear \eqref{eq:acoattenuation} and $dB$ forms \eqref{eq:acoattenuationdb} is given as;

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:acoattenuation}
  A_{\text{aco}}(d,f) = A_0d^ka(f)^d
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:acoattenuationdb}
  10 \log A_{\text{aco}}(d,f)/A_0 = k \cdot 10 \log d + d \cdot 10 \log a(f)
\end{equation}

where $A_0$ is a unit-normalising constant, $k$ is a geometric spreading factor (commonly taken as 1.5 for practical use, but may be 2 for perfect spherical propagation or 1 for perfect plane-wave propagation)), and $a(f)$ is the absorption coefficient, that may be modelled in a variety of ways.

Thorp's formula (\autoref{eq:thorp}) is very simple, only depending on $f$, and is designed to be most accurate about a temperature of 4$^{\circ}$C at a depth of $\approx 1Km$.
%
\begin{figure}
  \begin{equation}
    10 \log a(f) = 0.11 \cdot \frac{f^2}{1+f^2} + 44\cdot\frac{f^2}{4100+f^2}+ 2.75\times10^{-4} f^2 + 0.003
    \label{eq:thorp}
  \end{equation}
  \caption[Thorp's formula]{Thorp's Absorption Model\cite{Stojanovic2007}}
    \label{fig:thorp}
\end{figure}
%
The Ainslie \& McColm model is more complex, and incorporates the acidity of the water ($H^+$) as well as temperature ($T$), salinity ($S$ in parts per trillion) but not depth (\autoref{fig:ainslie}).
%
\begin{figure}
  \begin{align}
    10 \log a(f) =& 0.106 \frac{t_1 f^2}{t_1^2 + f^2} e^{\frac{H^+-8}{0.56}}\\\notag
      & + 0.52 \left(1+\frac{T}{43}\right)\left(\frac{S}{35}\right)\frac{t_2f^2}{t_2^2+f^2} e^{\frac{-D}{6}}\\\notag
      & + 4.9 \times 10^{-4} f^2e^{-\left(\frac{T}{27}+\frac{D}{17}\right)}\\\notag
      \text{Where}&\\\notag
      t_1 =& 0.78 \sqrt{\frac{S}{35}e^{\frac{T}{26}}}\\\notag
      t_2 =& 42 e^{\frac{T}{17}}\notag

    t_1=&1.32\times 10^3\left(T+273.1\right)e^{\frac{-1700}{T+273.1}}\\\notag

    \label{eq:fisher}
  \end{align}
  \caption{Fisher-Simmons Absorption Model}
  \label{fig:fisher}
\end{figure}
%
The Fisher-Simmons model (\autoref{fig:fisher}) is significantly more complex, taking into account the effects of boric acid concentrations and dissolved magnesium sulphate. While there are several limitations on this model in terms of its being fixed at a salinity of 35 ppt and a pH of 8, as this model incorporates depth, temperature, distance and frequency, it is very attractive for research directed at high variability environments.

%\todo{Possibly need to switch this with the Francois Garrison model which, depending on your source, is the refined version (or vise versa}



Regardless of the variations of particular attenuation models, comparing $A_{aco}(d,f)$ with the RF Free-Space Path Loss model $(A_{\text{RF}}(d,f) \approx \left( \frac{4\pi d f}{c} \right)^2)$, the impact of range on signal power is exponential underwater, rather than quadratic in terrestrial RF ($A_{\text{aco}} \propto f^{2d}$ vs $A_{\text{RF}} \propto (df)^2$). 
While both frequency dependant factors are quadratic, approximating the factors in \eqref{eq:thorp}, $f\propto A_{\text{aco}}$ is at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than $f\propto A_{\text{RF}}$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fspl}
  A_{\text{RF}}(d,f) \approx \left( \frac{4\pi d f}{c} \right)^2
  \text{where }c\approx 3\times10^8ms^{-1}
\end{equation}


 \subsection{Ambient Noise Model}

 Ambient ocean noise can be assumed to be Gaussian with a continuous power spectral density in dB re $\mu$Pa per Hz, driven by four major factors, shown in \autoref{tab:ocean_noise_factors}, where $s$ is a shipping activity factor bounded from $[0,1]$ and $w$ is the surface wind speed in $ms^{-1}$ \cite{coates1989}.

\begin{table}[h]\centering
  \caption{Contributing factors to Ocean Ambient Acoustic Noise}
  \label{tab:ocean_noise_factors}
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{3.5cm} X}\toprule
    Source & Approximation \\ \midrule
    Turbulence & $10 \log N_t(f)=17-30\log f$\\
    Shipping & $10 \log N_s(f) = 40+20(s-0.5)+26\log f-60\log(f+0.03)$\\
    Wind Driven Waves & $10\log N_w(f) = 50+7.5w^{\frac{1}{2}}+20\log f - 40\log(f+0.4)$\\ 
    Thermal Noise & $10\log N_{th}(f) = \-15 + 20 log f$\\\bottomrule
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Multipath effects}

Refractive lensing and the multi-path nature of the medium result in line of sight propagation being extremely unreliable for estimating distances to targets.
The first arriving acoustic signal has as the very least curved in the medium, and commonly has reflected off the surface/seabed before arriving at a receiver, creating secondary paths that are sometimes many times longer than the first arrival path, generating symbol spreading over orders of seconds depending on the ranges and depths involved.
Thus, the multi-path channel transfer function can be described by 

\begin{align}
  \label{eq:acomultipath}
  H(d,f) =\sum_{p=0}^{P-1} h(p) = \sum_{p=0}^{P-1} \Gamma_p / \sqrt{A(d_p,f)}e^{-j 2 \pi f \tau_p} \\
  \text{where } \tau_p = d_p/c, c \approx 1500 ms^{-1} \notag
\end{align}

where $d=d_0$ is the minimal path length between the transmitter and receiver, $d_p,p=\{1,\dots P-1\}$ are the secondary path lengths, $\Gamma_p$ models additional losses incurred on each path such as reflection losses at the surface interface, and $\tau_p = d_p/c$ is the delay time.




\subsection{Modelling and Simulation of the Acoustic Medium / Channel}

Several toolkits exist in a variety of states that perform communications agent simulation, most notably the NS-2 / 3 family of frameworks and their addons.
Some of these frameworks, such as SUNSET \cite{Petrioli2012a} and AquaTools \cite{Sehgal2010}.

Beyond the NS family, there are many other communications and simulation modelling systems such as OpNet++\cite{Chang1999} and MATLAB toolkits such as the AcTUP interface to the Ocean Acoustics Library.

\subsection{Conclusion}



\section{Marine Operations, Payloads and Technologies}\label{sec:marine_ops}

The use and applications of \glspl{auv} has undergone a great expansion in recent years\cite{Alam2014}.
The primary application for \glspl{auv} has long been identified as the environmental monitoring of marine areas, and are actively being researched by a great range of industrial and defence sector applications, with secondary applications in the physical sciences and environmental research, which are summarised below\cite{Bingham2002,Wynn2014}.

\subsection{\gls{auv} operations and deployments}

\subsubsection{Hydrographic Survey}

The use of \glspl{auv} in the place of manned-surface platforms or tethered undersea platforms enables greatly increased spatial and temporal sampling.
Importantly, the separation of \glspl{auv} from the noisy sea surface enables much more efficient survey operations.
This is particularly important when comparing to classical tow-line based measurements; where the mobility of the \glspl{auv} enables for much tighter-turning survey patterns or operation in inaccessible or hard-to-reach locations such as polar survey\cite{Curtin1993}.

Another significant factor is cost; the daily cost of operating a manned vessel can be considerably higher than the costs of deploying, operating and recovering one or more \glspl{auv} with equivalent capabilities\cite{Nicholson2008}.
Additionally, the use of low-power ``glider'' \glspl{auv} has lowered the barrier to entry for extended mission types, such as persistent environmental survey, or open-ocean operations. 
Depth-hardened \glspl{auv} have also opened up the deepest parts of the oceans to exploration, with the onboard autonomy, imagery and Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) techniques allowing deep-dwelling survey \glspl{auv} to react to bottom-surface features without the need for a tight craft-to-surface control loop.
The natural extension of these kind of applications is the use of \glspl{auv} on ice-covered planets such as Europa, where three-dimensional, autonomous navigation without an on-the-loop controller is vital for mission resource efficiency and success.

\subsubsection{Hull and Infrastructure Inspection}
Ongoing concerns regarding the security, safety and legality of international shipping has driven the application of \glspl{auv} to the area of near-surface hull and infrastructure inspections, looking for damage as well as devices such as limpet mines and other contraband.
This use case puts a range of unique pressures on the AUV system; requiring highly accurate three-dimensional localisation and path-planning to clearly image the contours of a hull\cite{Nicholson2008}.
Similarly, with the increasing use and criticality of intercontinental undersea optical fibre connections, using \glspl{auv} for both the laying of and inspection of these cables is an exciting area of work\cite{Yu2004}\cite{Asakawa2002}.

\subsubsection{Marine Petrochemical/Mineralogy}
Oil and Gas industry requirements for high quality, low altitude bathymetry of seabed structures for infrastructure development (pipelines/drill platforms etc.) as well as monitoring of those structures over time (inspection etc.) is another significant application area, and a major driver of research investment.
As in Hydrography, the mobility of \glspl{auv} is the biggest single advantage over classical platforms\cite{Morr2003}.
Additionally, recent advances in \gls{sas} have provided invaluable sub-surface profile data over much wider areas for multi-spectral mineralogical analysis than previous sonar profilers\cite{Denny2015}.

\subsubsection{Military}
Mine-Countermeasure Operations benefit greatly from, and significantly drive, \gls{auv} development; the ability to rapidly explore and covertly survey a potentially dangerous area without risking a human operator is a major benefit.
This benefit applies to protection as well as incursion; the ability to have persistent survey of a valuable area such as a forward-operating harbour is increasingly essential, and as AUV technology, autonomy and security practices develop, this use is increasing.
This Port Protection capability is particularly complex;  teams of \glspl{auv} are expected to repeatedly survey an area and remain densely-connected enough to maintain end-to-end communications with all other nodes, in the face of an environment that is possibly not well surveyed initially, and includes dynamically moving obstacles (i.e.\ ships).
In Sec.~\ref{sec:sim_and_valid}, we use this Port Protection scenario as a baseline for our simplified simulation context.

\subsection{Localisation Technologies}

Given the subsurface nature of most \gls{auv} operations, terrestrial localisation techniques such as \gls{gps} are unavailable (below $\approx 20cm$ depth). 
However, a range of alternative techniques are used to maintain spacial awareness to a high degree of accuracy in the underwater environment.
\subsubsection{\gls{lbl}}
Long-baseline localisation systems use a series of static surface/cable networked acoustic transponders to provide coordinated beacons and (usually) \gls{gps}-backed relative location information to local subsurface users. 
Such systems can be accurate to less that $0.1m$ or better in ideal deployments and are regularly used in controlled autonomous survey environments such as harbour patrol operations where the deployment area is bounded. 
However, the initial set-up and deployment required in advance of any \gls{auv} operation makes \gls{lbl} difficult to utilise in unbounded or contended areas.
LBL systems can also be deployed on mobile surface platforms in the area (ships or buoys for example), but these applications put significant computational pressure on the end-point AUV and have greatly reduced accuracy compared to ideal deployments\cite{Matos1999}.
\subsubsection{\gls{dvl}}
Doppler Velocity Logging involves the emission of directed acoustic ``pings'' that reflect off sea bed/surface interfaces that, when received back on the craft with multi-beam phased array acoustic transducers can measure both the absolute depth/altitude (z-axis) of the craft and through directional Doppler shifting, the relative (xy-translative) motion of the craft since the ping.
While classical \gls{dvl} was highly sensitive to shifting currents in the water column, advances in the development of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling has turned that situation on it's head, enabling the compensation-for and measurement-of water currents down to the sub-meter level\cite{Snyder2010}.
\subsubsection{\gls{ins}}
Inertial navigation systems use gyroscopic procession to observe the relative acceleration of a mobile platform.
This reference-relative monitoring is particularly useful in the underwater environment, as it detects the motion of \glspl{auv} as they are carried by the water itself.
Bias Drift is a significant problem for \gls{ins} systems operating over longer (hundreds of metres) distances, as they usually have some minimal amount of directional bias, that incurs a cumulative effect over time without assistance.
Several sensor synthesis processes have been demonstrated which combine information from \gls{ins} along with \gls{dvl} data to improve localisation into the sub-decimeter level\cite{Jalving2003,Liu2014,Allotta2015}.
\subsubsection{\gls{slam}}
Simultaneous Location and Mapping is the process of iteratively developing a feature-based model of an environment, and to use the relative movement within that modelled environment to obtain estimates of absolute positioning.
\gls{slam} has been most well developed in the contexts of either visual-based inspection using cameras, or LIDAR-style distance triangulation, however the same principles have been successfully applied using marine sonar readings, providing sub-meter accuracy, real-time, feature-relative localisation information that is (for the most part) environmentally agnostic\cite{Williams2000}.


In summary, current technology reliably enables \glspl{auv} to localise to a sub-metre accuracy in most areas of application.

\subsection{Payloads}

\todo{ADD: Do the same formatting as Localisation specifically on Sensors instead of this enumerate}

\glspl{auv} are capable of being loaded with a wide range of sensing payloads;
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\item Bathymetry
	\item Temperature/salinity/conductivity
	\item Side scanning sonar 
	\item Sub-bottom Sonar Profiling
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Potential Future Applications}
\todo{ADD NEXT: Future Applications of \glspl{auv}, mostly in the ``Actuation'' side of things as opposed to classical sensor payloads}

\subsection{Need for Trust in Maritime Networks}


Given the breadth of the threat space in \glspl{manet}, many strategies for mitigating these risks have been proposed in a matrix-basis; i.e. you can't cover all eventualities with one tool.
\autoref{tab:manet_risk} summaries some of these general strategies or ``solutions'' for range of threats identified specifically in the context of the deployment of \glspl{manet} in a tactical/defence context, originally based on \citet{Kidston2010} but with some contextual alterations with modifications discussed below.

In this context of this table, Vulnerability is an assessment of how available a particular threat is to a generic attacker, Impact is an assessment of the in-system affects of a successful attack, and Risk is a qualitative assessment of the likelihood of exploitation of an attack.
\citet{Kidston2010} originally lowered the assessment of vulnerability of Eavesdropping, citing the tactical use of non-standard \gls{mac} as a barrier to attack, however considering the increasing commoditisation of tactical hardware across the world, and increasing application of \gls{cots} hardware, this is no longer a fair assessment.
Similarly, the assessment that the Risk of Data Corruption is low is arguable on the basis of simplistic spread spectrum jamming but this assessment is unchanged.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Risks and Threat Mitigation Strategies for \glspl{manet}, extended from \cite{Kidston2010}}
	\label{tab:manet_risk}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X X X X X}\toprule
		Threat & Vulnerability & Impact & Risk & Mitigation	\\\midrule
		Resource Depletion / \gls{dos} & Low-High & High & Low-High & Layer Specific Mechanisms\cite{Wu2007,Nwaocha2015}\\
		Eavesdropping & Medium & High & Low & Cryptography \cite{Chen2010}\\
		Masquerade & Low & Very High & Medium & Trust Systems\cite{Wang2009a} and Cryptography\\
		Data Corruption & Low & High & Low & Cryptography\\
		Traffic Analysis & High & Low & Medium & Obfuscation\cite{Huang2010}\\
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Resource Depletion, or \gls{dos} has a very wide ranging definition, from network-level attacks to saturate a communications channel or the computing resources of routing nodes, or the exploitation of a power-control loop to induce a node to waste energy with overly-high-powered communications, to the intentional geographic misleading of nodes to induce a similar power-drain on locomotive systems, through tactics such as location spoofing or \gls{gps} denial.

With respect to the critical, and from \autoref{tab:manet_risk}, it is assessed that the highest overall threats are those of Resource Depletion and Masquerading.

\section{Conclusion}

As \acrfull{auv} platforms become more capable and economical, they are being used in many applications requiring trust.
These applications are using the collective behaviour of teams or fleets of these \glspl{auv} to accomplish tasks \cite{Caiti2011}.
With this use being increasingly isolated from stable communications networks, the establishment of trust between nodes is essential for the reliability and stability of such teams.
As such, the use of trust methods developed in the terrestrial \gls{manet} space must be re-appraised for application within the challenging underwater communications channel.
