\section{An Entropy-based Trust Modeling and Evaluation for Wireless Sensor Networks \citet*{Hongjun2008}}
\label{Honjun2008}
\begin{itemize}
  \item This paper is largely a derivative work of \cite{Liu2006} with the specific application to WSN\footnote{Wireless Sensor Networks} that goes into slightly further mathematical detail regarding the cumulative of entropy-based trust propagation. As such, it will be of little use.
\end{itemize}
