informal.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Title Slide} 
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, its an honour to be
invited to present our project here, and I hope you find it both intriguing and
enjoyable.

\section{AUVs}
\subsection{AUV Definition}
The general area of research selected is the
commercial, defence, and environmental use of interdependent groups of
Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, hereafter described as fleets. Now, it has
become very vogue to speak in research circles about 'swarms' of tiny robots.
Lets be clear; this is not the discussion at hand. In this context, these groups
could be numbered in the maximum of 10 or 12 individuals, acting more as a team
than a classical 'swarm'.

\subsection{Predators} But anyway\ldots After over 20 years of theoretical and
exploratory research into Unmanned Vehicles on, above, and below sea level, the recent
in-theatre use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles such as the USAF's Predator range,
has proven the effectiveness of autonomous or semi-autonomous ordnance delivery and reconnaissance platforms,
and this success has opened the field of research to a much wider range of
applications and platforms.

\subsubsection{Predators + AUV}  One area of particular interest to the research
community has been the transfer of ideas and technologies proven in the skies to
the marine environment.

\subsubsection{UAV Examples}  Three areas of particular interest to the research
community are swarming behaviours of small reconnaissance drones, analogous to
flocks of birds; human-guided operation, where by a remotely operated vehicle is 
flanked by a team of automated drones; and the use of task 'checkpointing'
where by automated drones perform a particular task or series of tasks, and 
then notify a remote operator to take over manual control for specific
operations.

\subsection{AUV Examples}  Bringing these type of technologies into the Naval
space has led to applications such minefield detection and monitoring, submarine tracking,
long range reconnaissance, deep-sea surveying, and much more. 

\subsection{La Spezia} Earlier this year,
successful trials were performed by NATO Underwater Research Centre at La Spezia
in Northern Italy investigating the collective performance of AUV's in port-protection in a
counter-terrorism operational context.

\subsubsection{(Blank)} The major focus of academic research into autonomous
robotic collectives in marine environments has been the development of
individual and pre-defined group behaviour patterns within a fleet and how
those individuals and teams communicate. However, the project introduced here
addresses an important and emerging area; the incorporation of communications
'trust' to improve the operational effectiveness and reliability of such fleets.

\section{Trust and Reputation Management}
\subsection{Trust}  The question of trust is an important one; it is the quantitative
assessment of the expected behaviour of a network node, in this case an
individual AUV. 

\subsubsection{Fleet Network}  
Taking the example of independent task-oriented operation, whereby fleets of
AUVs operate autonomously over extended periods, independently from any
persistent 'mother-ship', this fleet may need to occasionally communicate with
friendly ships or relay bouy's to return data for analysis or simply to notify
task-commanders to their status. This raises the point just stated of how do we
assess the trustworthiness of these extra-fleet entities such as the relay bouys
or 'friendly' ships.

\subsection{Internal Network}
Additionally, the fleet will have significant internal communications between
individual AUVs. In the case of above-sea-level UAV communication systems, this
would simply be over free-space radio, but the marine environment creates
significant challenges to even localised communications, due to factors such as
very low channel bandwidth, optical and acoustic scattering, and long
propagation delays.

\subsection{Physical}
As such, multiple technologies must be applied to enable underwater
communications, including free-space optical and \textbf{(acoustic)} acoustic
transmission systems, while \textbf{(radio)} radio is reserved for surface or
very short range applications. 

\subsubsection{Summary} 
If individuals can collaboratively predict
the probability that a given node will 'succeed or fail' in a given task, be that relaying a message
or providing useful data, this makes the total network much more robust and
secure. This collaborative behaviour requirement leads to the two basic trust
mechanisms; direct and indirect recommendations. 

\subsection{Example}
Direct being from historical
experience between two entities, and indirect effectively representing a
'trusted opinion'  or trustworthiness reported, by a third entity, known to
both.

These different trust assessments can also be propagated along
multiple chains of trust. These can be collated to generate trustworthiness
values across the local net. This transfer of trust knowledge is
usually described as multipath propagation.

\subsection{Summary Again}
This raises a range of important questions, which our research aim to answer;
how does a fleet entity assess the trust of another entity of which it has no
experience of? What about if it recieves a trust recommendation for something
else from an entity that it doesn't have any experience of? Given the multiple
physical mediums used for communications, and their generally poor quality, how
can one differentiate between abnormal behaviour due to these effects, or due to
actual bad behaviour.

\subsubsection{Loner}  Further, due to the extended mission times of such
fleets, and their planned isolation from classical command and control structures, they
necessarily become vulnerable to attacks to subvert their objective; or to
obtain or otherwise compromise the information they intend to report; or in
even worse cases, to execute commands in field outside of the required
authority. This raises the question of reliably maintaining secure audit
records, and returns us to the biggest question of assuring the identity of the
members and associates of a fleet in a distributed fashion so that there is no
single point of weakness.

\subsubsection{Healthy fleet}  One would imagine that authentication to be
fairly simple; keep a record of some identifying factor, and don't talk to
anyone else. But in a practical sense, the size and composition of the fleet
can be legitimately variable over time; with defective or otherwise
incapacitated units 'dropping off' \textbf{(Dead Battery)-(fleet 4)} and fresh
or specialised units being rolled out in-theatre \textbf{(fleet 6)} to join a
particular fleet.

\subsubsection{Evil fleet}  This situation presents an obvious method of
exploitation; as an enemy attacker, I destroy one of the existing fleet members,
wait for the fleet to issue a significant, out of schedule data burst that I can
assume to be 'reinforcements please'. I then drop one of my own 'clones'; a copy
as close as I can reliably manufacture to the original fleet members. With no
prior knowledge of the clone, the fleet could conceviably accept the clone as
one of their own. 

\subsubsection{Evil Base} I then retire to my local base in a hollowed out
volcano and watch the lovely surveillence data flow in.

\subsection{Blank}
It is these challenges that are the driving force of the proposed research. To
date there has been little or no vulnerability analysis of fleets of AUVs. This
project initially seeks to identify a range of threat models for fleets of
AUVs; representative of real-mission events, for instance; passive
eave's-dropping of communications; fleet infiltration using cloned AUVs or
surface vessels; or partial fleet destruction to compromise mission
capabilities.

\subsection{MANETS}  These threats have similarities to those experiences by
mobile ad-hoc networks, usually abbreviated as MANETs. Therefore
a key initial area will be to investigate the applicability of existing research
in those areas to the stated problem context. This would include research into
existing modelling techniques as well as any protocols and behaviours used to
counter these threats in the MANET space.

Any discussion of trust within this context leads to the need for a distributed
trust and reputation management framework; using individuals past experiences to
gauge the expected behaviour of a node, and sharing and collaboratively updating
that trust in a distributed network. Most current systems, such as Objective
Trust Management Framework or OTMF, \textbf{(OTMF Def)} use only one physical or
protocol measurement to make these trustworthiness decisions, but recent work 
by ECIT's own Bella Guo has applied multi-parametric classification techniques
such as Grey Theory \textbf{(Grey Def)} to not only detect abnormal behaviour
but also to recognise what type of attack is being attempted.

\subsubsection{Network Again} 
Due to the previously stated marine effects on transmission,
even assuming that existing trust structures in MANETS could be deemed
applicable to AUV operations, the metric-sets applied would have to be completely re-approached to
take account of the unique communications environment. Normally, the types of
metrics assessed involve packet loss rates, packet delay, and communications
throughput, but additional physical layer metrics such as Received Signal
Strength,and more behavioural metrics such as expected distance and deviations
from expected motion paths, are being investigated to complement these MAC layer
metrics.

The significant objects of work can be summarised as: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{(DC1)}  1. An assessment of vulnerabilities to a fleet of AUVs
	during typical operations with an aim to develop a suitable threat model
	\item\textbf{(DC2)}  2. Identification of marine-specific metrics 
	suitable to discriminate between legitimate and suspicious AUV behaviour.
	\item\textbf{(DC3)}  3. Development of a distributed trust management framework
	incorporating reputation analysis schemes throughout a fleet of AUVs
	\item\textbf{(DC4)}  4. And finally to explore and assess the feasibility of
	the framework for use across a range of operational tasks with an aim to integrate
	into existing defence frameworks such as the MOD Architecture Framework aka	MODAF or the French AGATE, which is basically the same but I am not	sure on the pronounciation yet\ldots Atelier de	Gestion de l'ArchiTEcture des systemes d'information et de communication, which	roughly translates as the Office for the management of architecture of	communications and information systems\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pools}  While the majority of the work is expected to be
theoretical development and simulation of threat models, the facilities afforded
by my co-supervisor, Professor Fontaine's robotics group (CRIIF, Centre de
Robotique Integree d'ile de France) at UPMC (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie)
in France, and his access to NURC in La Spezia will provide access to real AUVsystems. This experience is essential to determining real-world performance ofdifferent metric-sets, and to evaluate the practicality of such schemes.
\section{Project Structure}  
\subsection{Team}
Both supervisors have extensive experience in defence
research, including research within the areas of Networking and AUV operations;
Most of you already know that Professor Marshall has been involved in the
assessment, development and implementation of reliable and secure wireless
networks for over 12 years, and Professor Fontaine is an established expert in
the field of AUVs, including involvement with a number of NATO initiatives in
this area, and has ties to research organisations such as the NATO Undersea
Research Centre that will provide essential practical resources to this project.

\subsection{Project Monitoring}  
Beyond internal team monitoring, the monitoring structures in
place within Queen's endeavour to keep our PhD projects on track. Queen's
institutes two major review points within the first year of the project, called the 'Three Month
Report', and the Nine Month Differentiation, and I'm sure most of you are aware
of the general structure of these two checkpoints. I'm currently in the process
of drafting the three month report, if Alan would stop putting me up for
presentations!

\subsection{Defence Context}  Moving on, the interest for defence for this
project is clear; and we managed to tick the boxes on four areas of
DSTL's stated areas of strategic importance; namely Certification of Autonomous
Systems; Shallow Oceanic Zone and Coastal Environment; Security and
Vulnerability; as well as Human Operator Control of Unmanned Vehicles.

\subsubsection{Defence Feedback}  In terms of outcomes of this research; this
work would provide the ability for a fleet of AUVs to operate over a much wider
range of operations for much longer periods of time, in a much more secure and
reliable state.

The self-detection and classification of abnormal behaviour within a fleet in
the proposed distributed manner opens up the potential of a new range of secure
and self-learning distributed intrusion detection systems, with potential
applications both below and above the seas. If a general protocol could be
generated for this problem, this could be applied to self-driving cars,
environmental survey drones, satellite communications arrays,
internet Certificate Authority verification, and many more fields. But that
might have to be someone elses project to finish!

\section{Cheers}  Thank you for your time, and I'd be happy to answer any questions
you might have.\end{doublespace}
