abstract = {What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? LESS is a surgical technique that is utilized in many urological surgeries. The recent fusion of robotics and conventional LESS has significant implications for the future direction of LESS. This study is a review of LESS surgery, with a discussion about emerging technologies and the future directions of LESS surgery. • Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is a term that covers a spectrum of surgical techniques that perform laparoscopic surgery by consolidating all ports into one surgical incision. • In recent years, there has been an expansion of LESS surgical techniques with a wide spectrum of urological procedures being performed using LESS surgery. • Paralleling the clinical expansion of LESS are efforts to improve the instrumentation and access devices as well as incorporation of robotic platforms to the LESS arena. • This expansion in technology has generated the essential question: is robotics the future of LESS?},

In contrast, apologies in collective-agency cultures (such as Japan) are understood to be general expressions of remorse rather than a means to assign culpability. A survey of Japanese and Americans found that, compared to Americans, Japanese apologized more often and were more likely to apologize for actions in which they were not involved; on the other hand, Americans were more likely than Japanese to equate apologizing with personal blame. A subsequent experimental study showed that these cultural differences in the function and meaning of apologies have implications for trust repair in disputes: Apologies for integrity violations led to greater trust repair for Japanese than for Americans, but apologies for competence violations were somewhat more effective for Americans than Japanese. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

@article{Caiti2012,
abstract = {Methodologies and algorithms are presented for the secure cooperation of a team of autonomous mobile underwater sensors, connected through an acoustic communication network, within surveillance and patrolling applications. In particular, the work proposes a cooperative algorithm in which the mobile underwater sensors (installed on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles-AUVs) respond to simple local rules based on the available information to perform the mission and maintain the communication link with the network (behavioral approach). The algorithm is intrinsically robust: with loss of communication among the vehicles the coverage performance (i.e., the mission goal) is degraded but not lost. The ensuing form of graceful degradation provides also a reactive measure against Denial of Service. The cooperative algorithm relies on the fact that the available information from the other sensors, though not necessarily complete, is trustworthy. To ensure trustworthiness, a security suite has been designed, specifically oriented to the underwater scenario, and in particular with the goal of reducing the communication overhead introduced by security in terms of number and size of messages. The paper gives implementation details on the integration between the security suite and the cooperative algorithm and provides statistics on the performance of the system as collected during the UAN project sea trial held in Trondheim, Norway, in May 2011.},

This chapter identifies 10 human supervisory control challenges that could significantly impact operator performance in NCOs: information overload, attention allocation, decision biases, supervisory monitoring of operators, distributed decision making through team coordination, trust and reliability, the role of automation, adaptive automation, multimodal technologies, and accountability. NCOs will bring increases in the number of information sources, volume of information, and operational tempo with significant uncertainty, all of which will place higher cognitive demands on operators. Thus, it is critical that NCO research focuses not only on technological innovations but also on the strengths and limitations of human-automation interaction in a complex system.},

@book{Bekey2005,
abstract = {Autonomous robots are intelligent machines capable of performing tasks in the world by themselves, without explicit human control. Examples range from autonomous helicopters to Roomba, the robot vacuum cleaner. In this book, George Bekey offers an introduction to the science and practice of autonomous robots that can be used both in the classroom and as a reference for industry professionals. He surveys the hardware implementations of more than 300 current systems, reviews some of their application areas, and examines the underlying technology, including control, architectures, learning, manipulation, grasping, navigation, and mapping. Living systems can be considered the prototypes of autonomous systems, and Bekey explores the biological inspiration that forms the basis of many recent developments in robotics. He also discusses robot control issues and the design of control architectures. After an overview of the field that introduces some of its fundamental concepts, the book presents background material on hardware, control (from both biological and engineering perspectives), software architecture, and robot intelligence. It then examines a broad range of implementations and applications, including locomotion (wheeled, legged, flying, swimming, and crawling robots), manipulation (both arms and hands), localization, navigation, and mapping. The many case studies and specific applications include robots built for research, industry, and the military, among them underwater robotic vehicles, walking machines with four, six, and eight legs, and the famous humanoid robots Cog, Kismet, ASIMO,"and QRIO. The book concludes with reflections on the future of robotics -- the potential benefits as well as the possible dangers that may arise from large numbers of increasingly intelligent and autonomous robots.},

Population characteristics from these studies are compared with results from a 1977-79 study in sandstone escarpment country 40 km to the south-east and from studies in a range of habitats on the Mitchell Plateau in the Kimberley. Populations in rocky country are most dense with animals often surviving two or three years. In contrast, populations in savanna are more sparse, with males and females rarely surviving beyond one mating season. While all populations seem to undergo an annual period of stress, it is the savanna populations that seem most vulnerable. An analysis of the distribution of northern quolls shows a 75{\%} recent range reduction, from being widespread over much of northern Australia to six smaller rocky regions. Possible causes of the decline include cattle, cane toads and exotic disease.},

abstract = {In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), a source node must rely on intermediate nodes to forward its packets along multi-hop routes to the destination node. Due to the lack of infrastructure in such networks, secure and reliable packet delivery is challenging. We propose a robust cooperative trust establishment scheme to improve the reliability of packet delivery in MANETs, particularly in the presence of malicious nodes. In the proposed scheme, each node determines the trustworthiness of the other nodes with respect to reliable packet forwarding by combining first-hand trust information obtained independently of other nodes and second-hand trust information obtained via recommendations from other nodes. First-hand trust information for neighbor nodes is obtained via direct observations at the MAC layer whereas first-hand information for non-neighbor nodes is obtained via feedback from acknowledgements sent in response to data packets. The proposed scheme exploits information sharing among nodes to accelerate the convergence of trust establishment procedures, yet is robust against the propagation of false trust information by malicious nodes. We present simulation results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in a variety of scenarios involving nodes that are malicious with respect to both packet forwarding and trust propagation. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The performance of ad hoc networks depends on co-operation and trust among distributed nodes. To enhance security in ad hoc networks, it is important to evaluate trustworthiness of other nodes without centralized authorities. In this paper, we present an information theoretic framework to quantitatively measure trust and model trust propagation in ad hoc networks. In the proposed framework, trust is a measure of uncertainty with its value represented by entropy. We develop four Axioms that address the basic understanding of trust and the rules for trust propagation. Based on these axioms, we present two trust models: entropy-based model and probability-based model, which satisfy all the axioms. Techniques of trust establishment and trust update are presented to obtain trust values from observation. The proposed trust evaluation method and trust models are employed in ad hoc networks for secure ad hoc routing and malicious node detection. A distributed scheme is designed to acquire, maintain, and update trust records associated with the behaviors of nodes' forwarding packets and the behaviors of making recommendations about other nodes. Simulations show that the proposed trust evaluation system can significantly improve the network throughput as well as effectively detect malicious behaviors in ad hoc networks. 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), each node should not only work for itself, but should be cooperative with other nodes. Under such environment, some nodes may misbehave for individual interests. Currently two categories of trust management frameworks, reputation-based framework and trust establishment framework, are used to guarantee nodes to perform normal behavior. However, in reputation-based framework, it is unreasonable that only one parameter, trust value, is considered. Meanwhile, the trust establishment framework is vulnerable under the selective misbehavior attack, by which the attacker performs different behaviors to different nodes. To solve these problems, we propose an objective trust management framework (OTMF) for MANETs, by which one node evaluates the trustworthiness of another node objectively based not only on direct observations, but on second-hand information. To compare the OTMF with the existing frameworks, we provide performance evaluation. The evaluation results show that the OTMF can obtain more reliable trust than the reputation-based framework and can prevent the selective misbehavior attack more effectively than the trust establishment framework.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Present generation AUVs act as mobile sensor platforms, allowing post mission debriefs which require little more than an adequate expression of the collected data, and only basic requirements for mission planning. As the need and capability advances, autonomy will increase in turn, leading to more complex missions, which must be supported by more capable operator interfaces, both for post mission debrief and pr e-mission verification, lest a deficit of trust form between the vehicles and their operators. We present Glaykos, a system designed to automatically create audio visual debriefs for missions carried out with both real and simulated vehicles, allowing it to act as a tool for both pre-mission verification and post mission debrief. A series of data transforms are applied to the domain information and mission logs from an AUV mission, resulting in the creation of an audio visual debrief whose structure is informed by principles of human computer interaction and narrative. The approach is tested for effectiveness and results of this are presented, showing that it better able to keep users informed when compared two other debriefing strategies, one of which mimics the current state of the art. Conclusions are drawn regarding the system's monologue based approach acting as a first step towards more complex and capable multimodal, dialogue based operator interfaces for autonomous systems.},

abstract = {Mobile ad-hoc networking works properly only if the participating nodes cooperate in routing and forwarding. However,it may be advantageous for individual nodes not to cooperate. We propose a protocol, called CONFIDANT, for making misbehavior unattractive; it is based on selective altruism and utilitarianism. It aims at detecting and isolating misbehaving nodes, thus making it unattractive to deny cooperation. Trust relationships and routing decisions are based on experienced, observed, or reported routing and forwarding behavior of other nodes. The detailed implementation of CONFIDANT in this paper assumes that the network layer is based on the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. We present a performance analysis of DSR fortified by CONFIDANT and compare it to regular defenseless DSR. It shows that a network with CONFIDANT and up to 60{\%} of misbehaving nodes behaves almost as well as a benign network, in sharp contrast to a defenseless network. All simulations have been implemented and performed in GloMoSim.},

abstract = {Path loss of an underwater acoustic communication channel depends not only on the trans- mission distance, but also on the signal frequency. As a result, the useful bandwidth de- pends on the transmission distance, a feature that distinguishes an underwater acoustic system from a terrestrial radio one. This fact influences the design of an acoustic network: a greater information throughput is available if messages are relayed over multiple short hops instead of being transmitted directly over one long hop. We asses the bandwidth de- pendency on the distance using an analytical method that takes into account physical mod- els of acoustic propagation loss and ambient noise. A simple, single-path time-invariant model is considered as a first step. To assess the fundamental bandwidth limitation, we take an information-theoretic approach and define the bandwidth corresponding to optimal signal energy allocation – one that maximizes the channel capacity subject to the constraint that the transmission power is finite. Numerical evaluation quantifies the bandwidth and the channel capacity, as well as the transmission power needed to achieve a pre-specified SNR threshold, as functions of distance. These results lead to closed-form approximations, which may become useful tools in the design and analysis of acoustic networks.},

The method proposed in this study would increase the survivability of those injured or trapped by a disaster event by providing a facility to allow citizens to coordinate and share information among themselves.

A deficit in trust may arise between the operator and an AUV which is able to modify its own plan and potentially behave in a not observably deterministic fashion. There have been some notable previous attempts to bring the plan used in an autonomous system closer to the user, but AUVs represent a relatively new technology which operates in a particular and limited domain for which this infrastructure does not yet exist. Here we present a framework to bring state and purpose of the mission as close to the user as possible. Natural language and high level graphics, which take influence from computer games in order to engender familiarity, are used as as key components of both the input and output of our suggested plan creation system. This allows the user to satisfy themselves of the validity of a plan and the competence of the system before it is run on a real AUV.},

abstract = {Automation is often problematic because people fail to rely upon it appropriately. Because people respond to technology socially, trust influences reliance on automation. In particular, trust guides reliance when complexity and unanticipated situations make a complete understanding of the automation impractical. This review considers trust from the organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It considers how the context, automation characteristics, and cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The context in which the automation is used influences automation performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of trust, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved designs of systems that require people to manage imperfect automation.},

abstract = {We analyze the performance of underwater acoustic ad-hoc networks in the presence of interference. We assume a uniform distribution of nodes over a finite area, and focus for simplicity on a two-dimensional network. The node-to-node channel is modeled using frequency dependent path loss and Ricean fading. We adopt a communication theoretic approach and study the sustainable number of hops through the network as an indicator of the network connectivity, as well as power and bandwidth requirements. The network operation is highly dependent on the node density with two distinct regions of limited performance: the coverage-limited region, where the number of nodes in the network is small, and the interference-limited region, where the number of nodes is large. We show that a desired level of connectivity can be achieved through a judicious selection of the operating frequency, power and bandwidth. Numerical examples illustrate the results of the analysis. These results motivate us to propose a hierarchical underwater acoustic sensor network architecture in which the sensors and the collector stations operate in distinct layers. The hierarchical architecture is supported by the property of the acoustic underwater transmission medium that for each transmission distance there exists an operating frequency for which the narrow-band signal-to-noise ratio is maximized. The sensors and the collector stations are consequently allocated different operating frequencies. We assume a uniform distribution of both sensors and collector stations over the finite area of the sensing field, and model the channel accordingly. The analysis is performed under the assumption that there is interference from other nodes within the same layer of the hierarchy. Numerical examples illustrate the network performance and demonstrate that the preferred operating frequencies ensure network operation without any cross-interference between the collector network and the sensor network.},

abstract = {With the development of wireless network applications, wireless networks need more interactions between many entities, and a rapidly increasing requirement for designing secure applications among these entities is trust management. Therefore, a lot of attacks against distributed environment are aimed at the trust management. This article presents a new trust management framework (TMF) for Mobile Ad hoc Networks. The proposed framework calculates a node's trust value based on observations from neighbour nodes by using Grey theory and Fuzzy sets. The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment. The TMF has shown good performance in calculating trust values of mobile wireless nodes under normal and abnormal (attack) conditions, and hence can be considered as an effective trust framework for MANETs.},

abstract = {The concept of an agent has become important in both artificial intelligence (AT) and mainstream computer science. Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.},

abstract = {In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), a source node must rely on other nodes to forward its packets on multi-hop routes to the destination. Secure and reliable handling of packets by the intermediate nodes is difficult to ensure in an ad hoc environment. We propose a trust establishment scheme for MANETs, which aims to improve the reliability of packet forwarding over multi-hop routes in the presence of potentially malicious nodes. Using a Bayesian framework, each node assigns a “trustworthiness” value to each of its neighbor nodes based on direct observations of packet forwarding behavior. More generally, each node forms an “opinion” about each of the other nodes in the network, based on the set of trustworthiness values computed in the network. The opinion metric can be incorporated into ad hoc routing protocols to achieve reliable packet delivery even when a portion of the network exhibits malicious behavior. We present numerical results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust establishment scheme.

abstract = {The highly successful architecture and protocols of today's Internet may operate poorly in environments characterized by very long delay paths and frequent network partitions. These problems are exacerbated by end nodes with limited power or memory resources. Often deployed in mobile and extreme environments lacking continuous connectivity, many such networks have their own specialized protocols, and do not utilize IP. To achieve interoperability between them, we propose a network architecture and application interface structured around optionally-reliable asynchronous message forwarding, with limited expectations of end-to-end connectivity and node resources. The architecture operates as an overlay above the transport layers of the networks it interconnects, and provides key services such as in-network data storage and retransmission, interoperable naming, authenticated forwarding and a coarse-grained class of service.},

How- ever, as recent experience shows, the anonymous, open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files. We describe an algorithm to decrease the number of downloads of inauthentic files in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network that as- signs each peer a unique global trust value, based on the peer’s history of uploads. We present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values, based on Power iteration. By having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download, the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network. In simulations, this reputation system, called EigenTrust, has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on the network, even under a variety of conditions wheremalicious peers cooperate in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

abstract = {Neighbor Discovery is a fundamental building block in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks. But the very nature of wireless mobile networks makes it easy to abuse neighbor discovery, such as the wormhole attack which relaying the HELLO packet between two far away nodes make them establishing the neighborship, and thus disrupting the routing function. In this paper, we present a reputation system for neighbor discovery that helps the node to assess the authenticity of the neighborship. The reputation system provides a scheme based on grey theory to compute the neighboring probability which requires less sample data. From building the reputation table, the neighbor node made by the wormhole would be marked the lower value. Through the analysis and simulation, the results show that it is efficient to avoid the harm brought by the wormhole in neighbor discovery.},
