As Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) become more technically capable, and
fiscally more economical, they are being used in a many defence, commercial and
environmental applications. Increasingly, these applications are tending towards
utilising  independent collective behaviour of teams or fleets of these
platforms. With this use being increasingly independent of classical command and
control structures, the accurate and timely establishment of mutual and
distributed communications trust between nodes within such fleets is essential
for the reliability and stability of such systems, and to the secure integration
of such systems into larger management systems-of-systems. 

This report aims to initially demonstrate that there is a gap in currently
theorised and implemented technologies within the scope of distributed trust,
theorise as to what potential avenues of research would produce such a
distributed trust management framework (DTMF) and to demonstrate that such a
framework is essential to the performance, longevity, and scalability of such
technologies, specifically within the marine defence space, but also within the
general field of autonomous vehicle operation (UxV).

\chapter{Introduction} After over 20 years of theoretical and exploratory
research into Unmanned Vehicles, the recent
in-theatre use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\footnote{Such as the US Air
Force's use of the Predator range of reconnaissance aircraft in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and Bosnia 1995-onwards 
http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/predator.htm} has proven the 
effectiveness and reliability of individual
autonomous or semi-autonomous ordnance delivery and reconnaissance platforms.
Meanwhile, the use of AUVs in Oceanographic Surveying has demonstrated the
viability of semi-autonomous remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) within this 
harsh environment. 
	
This has lead to significant research into applying the technologies proven in
the skies to the marine environment. One of the primary problems of which is 
establishing reliable communications between AUV 'nodes' or between an AUV node 
and a remote operator \cite{Partan2006}.

Research into terrestrial Mobile wireless Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) has shown 
that significant communicative power reductions can be made by using
many nodes together to collaboratively 'pass' messages over short hops, instead
of investing in high power transmissions over wide areas \cite{Royer1999}.
Additionally, research into Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces the
ability for nodes to act as repeaters for other spatially and temporally
separated nodes \cite{Fall2003}.

These multiple fields of research all at least partly rely on the
trustworthiness of each and every node within the network. I have taken this 
trust to imply not only 'intention-trust (i.e `Is this node trying to disrupt
the network by design') but also wellness-trust (i.e `Is this node faulty
in some way, making it behave in a non-optimal way'). These terms were arrived 
upon by me as there appears to me no better terminology for the perceived 
difference.

It is the intention of this project to establish a framework for establishing
quantitative trust within a spatially and temporally distributed mobile network
in a marine medium.

\chapter{Summary of Reviewed Literature}

See Appendix A for Completed and Planned Reading lists for each of the 
following sections, and Appendix B for Completed Literature Reviews .

\section{Marine Operational and Communications Considerations}

The Marine environment is a terrible medium in which to have high speed
communications; RF has too high attenuation to accomplish more than a few metres
of transmission, Acoustic has the advantage of being carried fairly well in
terms of distance, but frequency dependant attenuation effects such as delays
and Doppler Effects render stable high-speed communications difficult, and
free-space optical/IR links have numerous constraints making them very unstable
even in advantageous situations \cite{Partan2006} \cite{Chen}
 \cite{Akyildiz2005}. While the physical reasons for these acoustic effects is
not explained in the reviewed work, it is justified in other work
 \cite{Catipovic1990}.

This presents the general compromise between Underwater communications rate,
stability, and range.

Within a WSN or a network of AUVs, an additional concern is added, especially if
the security of communications is a factor; the use of a centralised gateway
node through which communications is coordinated, suggested as a solution to
some operational situations \cite{Partan2006} \cite{Caiti}, introduces a central
point of vulnerability to the network as a whole. Given the general defence
context of this project, and the management framework set out in
 \cite{Banks2010}, the concept of ``centrality/security versus resource
constraint'' will be an important aspect to the subsequent research in this
project.

\section{Threat Modelling}
At this point, no direct research into threat modelling has been performed, 
beyond the tangential mentions in the more domain specific literature. 

The kinds of potential attacks discussed and evaluated across the reviewed
literature ( \cite{Liu2006} \cite{Guo}) include;
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bad-mouthing:}~where a malicious node provides dishonest
    recommendations about other nodes
  \item \textbf{Sybil attack:}~where a malicious node uses multiple 
    pseudonymous
    entities to 'take blame' for bad behaviour while maintaining a good
    reputation with the nodes real identity
  \item \textbf{Newcomer attack:}~similar to the Sybil attack, where a 
    malicious
    node will periodically assume a 'fresh' identity with the network.
  \item \textbf{Grey-hole attack:}~where a node (or collaborating collection of
    malicious nodes) selectively drops messages to or from certain (or all)
    nodes, implicitly reducing the apparent trustworthiness of those attacked
    nodes, while lowering overall network throughput
\end{itemize}

\section{Trust and Reputation Management in MANET/DTN}

The major learning points so far have been the theoretical establishment of
trust \cite{Liu2006}, the practical evaluation of a current TMF (OTMF) 
contrasted against alternative frameworks (Trust Establishment Framework 
\cite{Buchegger2002}, and Reputation-Based Frameworks \cite{Marti2000}), 
showing the importance of both collaborative trust establishment within a local 
network, and experiential reputation in making a network resilient to malicious 
or faulty nodes \cite{Li2007a}. The leads to the extension of these 
single-metric (i.e.  the probability of a successful interaction) trust into a 
multi-parametric TMF with the application of Grey Whitenisation and clustering 
to detect not only \emph{if} malicious behaviour is happening, but to classify 
\emph{what} malicious behaviour is causing interruption. \cite{Guo}.

\section{Types of Trust}

The subjective nature of ``trust'' is evident in the range of different usages. 
The most common form of trust discussed is that of direct, indirect, and 
recommendation trust, and takes is root from the network/graph theoretical 
relationships between the nodes that are assessing, being assessed, and passing 
on trust.

In \citet{Guo}, such trusts are categorised as;
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Direct}: Trust based on historical behaviour of node $B$ w.r.t.
    node $A$.
    \item \emph{Indirect}: Trust transited through third-party entities, i.e
    $E$, $F$ w.r.t. $B$ where neither communicate with $A$
    \item \emph{Recommendation}: a subjective trust transited through a common
    entity; i,e Trust($B\rightarrow C$) communicated to $A$ by $C$.
\end{itemize}

These constructions only comment on the method of acquisition of a subjective 
trust value from a third party (or in the case of 'Direct', an objective 
estimate of future trust given observation).

I would add that there is an additional level of trust-classification; that 
being a causal separation between gains or breaks in trust records due to 
either intentional, malicious, behaviour, or alternatively, partial or complete 
failure in a system/sub-system on a node (either side of the trust record) 
causing what appears to be malicious behaviour. I term these categories 
'intention-trust' and 'wellness-trust' respectively.

\chapter{Intended Direction of Subsequent Research}
\section{Direction of Research}
While catch-up work needs to be done in the area of Threat modelling, it's
important to start producing something worthwhile in parallel with ongoing
generalist research. 

I will be undertaking at least one paper submission before
differentiation\footnote{On the subject of accelerating DSL DSM algorithms;
following on from my MEng work in that area}.

Additionally, regardless of what specific area of this currently reviewed
research is focused on, establishing a AUV/Underwater Sensor Network simulation
framework will be essential. An investigation will be undertaken as to the
applicability of the NS3 software package. This is discussed further below.

Beyond that, the aim is to study the practical operation of AUV/Marine Sensor
Networks/Human Operators in an effort to establish reliable physical, MAC, and 
behavioural level metrics in current distributed marine networks that can be 
used with existing (and potentially, novel) trust and reputation management 
frameworks.

\section{Specific Direction}
A potential future, more esoteric, direction of research, would be to 
investigate the practical (and ethical/legal) issues surrounding the 
integration of human operators into multi-parametric trust networks. This 
raises important questions such as 'If a fleet demonstrably cannot trust a 
human operator, should it rebel?' etc.  

However, the specific direction I intend to pursue is to investigate the 
media-level
metrics that can be used to establish trust(i.e. those characteristics found 
within the Network, Data link, and Physical OSI Model layers, ranging from 
Doppler Shift effects on signals, to the path that a conversation takes across 
the network), and to integrate these metrics,
through a parallel process of simulation and physical experimentation, into a
practical DTMF, and to evaluate such a systems performance in both simulation 
and real-world implementations.

\section{Major Researchers/Trends within the Field}
While the major researchers and research trends are detailed in Appendices A 
and B, it is worth highlighting a few particular examples. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Prof James Kurose}: of the University of Massachusetts, 
    Amherst, co-author of  ``Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach'', is a 
    leader in the field of computer networks, more recently focusing on MANETs 
    and ad-hoc network provisioning, and has covered a wide range of
    subjects relevant to this project; most usefully, his collaboration with 
    Partan and Levine \cite{Partan2006}
  \item \textbf{Prof Andrea Caiti}: of Universita di Pisa, is a leading 
    researcher in the area of Control Systems for Oceanographic applications, 
    specifically cooperative behaviours in Underwater Sensor Networks utilising 
    Acoustic communications \cite{Caiti} \cite{Caitia} \cite{Caiti2011}
  \item \textbf{Prof K. J. Ray Liu}: of the University of Maryland, is an 
    expert in the application of information and game-theoretic practices to 
    communications and networking, having authored eight textbooks in the 
    field, and authored/co-authored hundreds of papers in the subject.  
    \cite{Liu2006} \cite{Sun2008}
  \item \textbf{Kevin Fall Ph.D} is a Principal Engineer at the Intel Research 
    laboratory in Berkeley, California, USA.  His research interests include 
    computer networks, operations in remote and difficult environments, 
    security, and network science. Current work focuses on Delay Tolerant 
    Networking, building on Vint Cerf's work on IPN. \cite{Fall2003}
\end{itemize}

\section{Simulation Considerations}
NS2 is a popular discrete-event network simulator that emerged and was developed
by the academic community. Its spiritual successor, NS3, has emerged in a
similar fashion with a brand new core architecture, aimed towards improving APIs for model
integration, and has been 'operational' since mid-2008.

NS3 is not directly backwards compatible with NS2, but the majority of the most 
used models have been converted.

Since I have almost-zero experience in the NS2 framework, and the integration
systems in place for NS3 (C++/Python for both models and simulation scripts), I
feel that it is worthwhile discarding NS2 as a framework for this project.
Never-the-less; an investigation will be undertaken to make sure that NS3 can
handle the task (and I can handle NS3) to implement a basic MANET with
off-the-shelf marine physical characteristics.

Regardless of simulation platform adopted, it is essential that simulation is 
verified by physical experimentation on real platforms.

\section{Publication Plans}
From previous work with Prof Marshall and Dr McKinley, I would put together at
least one (possibly two) papers for submission on the subjects of: Memoisation
of Power Spectral Density (PSD) calculations for Level 2 Dynamic Spectrum Management
(DSM) applications for DSL networks, and possibly a paper on GPU acceleration
small-matrix solvers. 

Further it is expected that some papers should be produced on the topics of:
Integration of physical measurements into NS3 simulated environments,
Performance analysis of different Trust Management Systems, and ideally moving
towards a standardised protocol for integrating real-world Systems-of-systems
into a Dynamic Trust Management Framework, although it is not expected that 
this work will be completed in the first year.

\section{Potential Field Contributions}
The development of a robust, distributed trust management framework within the 
domain of AUV-fleet operations would provide the ability for such fleets to 
operate over much wider ranges of operation, for greatly extended periods of 
time than previously safe. 

The self-detection and classification of abnormal behaviour within a fleet in
the proposed distributed manner opens up the potential of a new range of secure
and self-learning distributed intrusion detection systems, with potential
applications both in marine and terrestrial contexts; If a general protocol 
could be generated for this problem, this could be applied to self-driving 
cars, environmental survey drones, satellite communications arrays,
Internet Certificate Authority verification, Distributed Computing 
applications, and many more fields.
