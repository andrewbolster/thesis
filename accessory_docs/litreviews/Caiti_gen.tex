\section{Poster Abstract: Secure Cooperation of Mobile Sensors in an Underwater 
Acoustic Network \citet*{Caiti}}
\label{Caiti}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Covers methodologies and algorithms for protection-oriented operation of an asset by a team of AUVs in a UAN.
  \item References \cite{Curtin1993} regarding goal oriented operation.
  \item References \cite{Akyildiz2005}/\cite{Caitia} regarding channel state
  \item Takes an Application-level approach to communication; i.e. AUVs guided by an interest function which factors in the protection of an asset with maintaining stable comms.
  \item Refers to ReKeying service for group key revocation and generation (\cite{Dini}).
  \item Refers to CTS Encryption, maintaining ciphertext/plaintext size.
  \item Highlights DoS danger within Marine channel, states that derived behaviour will drive any nodes 'under attack' closer to their protection target naturally.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Questions Raised}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Does not comment on how RKS revocations are triggered. How are attacks recognised?
  \item Can similar emergant application level (i.e motive) behaviours be applied to the physical/logical levels so as to implement a few very simple rules that, when scaled, provide stable, robust behaviours?
\end{itemize}
