\section{Physical Layer; Channel and Technological Limitations}
\subsection{Acoustic Characteristics}
Covered in more depth in \cite{Catipovic1990}
\subsection{Radio Characteristics}
In general, \acro{RF} communications are heavily attenuated in salt water, but 
Long-wave radio can be used in short range links (\acro{122 kHZ}, 6-10m, 
1-8kbits/sec )
\subsection{Optical Characteristics}
Heavily scattered and absorbed in water, although blue-green wavelengths may be
used to short range (\lt100m) high bandwidth (several Mbits/s) connections in
particularly clear conditions. \cite{Partan2006}([10])

Also potentially viable (stated as 'considered) are the use of OTS IrDA
tranceivers (1-2m \@ 57.6kbits/s)
