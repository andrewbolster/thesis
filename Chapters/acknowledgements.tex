There are many people who deserve the highest thanks for their support, patience, kindness and understanding.
The greatest thanks have to be distributed among my family and friends, for putting up with my madness; both the madness of starting it and the madness of seeing it through.
Maybe I'll get a job that you can actually explain! 
Next, I must thank Professor Marshall, without whom this work wouldn't have been attempted let alone completed.
Finally, this PhD is dedicated to R, who knows why.
